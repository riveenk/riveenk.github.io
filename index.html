            <h3>50 Shades of Gender: Gender Complexity and Post-Gender Society</h3>
            <p>For much of recorded history, gender and sex were used interchangeably: male meant XY chromosomes and
                masculinity, female meant XX chromosomes and femininity. However, modern gender has evolved into a
                broader and more nuanced spectrum—some sources listing dozens—if not hundreds—of uniquely defined
                identities. This essay examines the nature of gender, and argues for abolishing gender as a descriptive
                identifying term.
                Historically, and even now in some societies, gender was a binary. I, myself, have seen and experienced
                what it feels like to be a part of such a society. Modern definition of “gender” has evolved away from
                “sex” into a social construct. However, the restriction of sex-gender equivalence is also a social
                construct. So, would it not be fair to argue that social categorisation is inherently restrictive? Let’s
                explore this. Suppose you have a gradient of colours. Perhaps it looks like the one below:</p>

            <h3>why it matters to remember</h3>
            <p>cecil richard’s under a star called sun is a reader-led short story about a narrator where “the
                trajectory of [his] ship is unchanging.” he (i like to see myself on the ship; you may too) recalls that
                the coffee “never tastes as good as the ones you get from the cafes back home,” as a quiet
                matter-of-fact.
                now, it’s very unlikely that the coffee could be so physically or chemically different than the ones
                here on earth. rather, the difference would make you laugh. i propose it is akin to how coffee your
                loved one makes is always better than starbucks (no offence). it is not the chemistry of your mug that
                matters, but rather the chemistry of your mind. but what is so important about this? he, remembers what
                earth felt like and what a world full of love feels like. even in his solitary moments with just coffee,
                his mind takes the trip back to home. it takes a very lonely astronaut to wish they were back home. we
                usually climb the ladder to the stars when we are alone on the soil.</p>

            <h3>Laboratory life: my work experience week at BGS</h3>
            <p>My week began with a welcome tour of the research facilities at BGS and, more specifically, the
                geochemistry laboratories. The team provided an introduction to the field of mass spectrometry and the
                use of isotopes in archaeological research. The sample preparation, which happens under very precise,
                controlled conditions to exclude contamination, involves a huge amount work prior to analysis. It wasn’t
                long before I was gaining hands-on experience working with carbon isotopes from organic and inorganic
                materials, preparing samples and then analysing them on mass spectrometers. For me, one of the
                highlights was learning how to handle samples down to 40 micrograms in weight — which I can confirm is
                difficult to see with the naked eye!</p>

            <h3>How to make a Debating Motion?</h3>
            <p> Today we will be talking about motions. I would be using debating terms like “motion” here and there,
                but I will always include a link of that word to my debating terminology glossary.

                Let’s get started. So, what is a motion? Basically, it is the topic which the debate is about. There are
                two sides which would be arguing this (although there could be four teams, sometimes). Without further
                ado, point number one:
                1. Balance is Key

                The first thing I would suggest you consider is whether there is a balanced argument to both sides. Can
                both sides make a case, can either side win? This is where the real skill of creating a motion comes
                into play. You shouldn’t make a motion where there is a defined answer to, for example, a motion like
                “THBT crime should not be punished”. These are questions which have a recognised answer to. </p>
