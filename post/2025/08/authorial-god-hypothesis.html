            <h2 class="body-header">The Authorial God Hypothesis</h2>
            <h4 class="body-subheader">07 August, 2025</h4>

            <p>God—in many belief systems and prominently, the Abrahamic tradition—is an omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, omnibenevolent, and perfect being. These faiths and beliefs also credit God for creating the universe and its inhabitants: us. Equally so, some faiths believe in multiple and more human-like Gods: the Ancient Greeks, Ancient Egyptians, and Hinduism are examples. There are even some beliefs that believe in a false God (Gnosticism) or one capable of malice (Dystheism). This is a simplified non-exhaustive overview of the diversity among those who do believe in a God/s. Within this range lies a God I would refer to as Authorial. This essay proposes a theological cosmology compatible with natural laws and divine causality, to reframe our relationship with our Creator and our understanding of will and purpose.</p>
            <p>The Authorial God is more likely than not to be aware of us. They are inherently omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent not because they are a supranatural being in the traditional sense, but because their narratives demand our existence. For example, if the Authorial God were to write of a solar eclipse, it would demand the existence of the Sun, the Earth, and the Moon. It would demand the sun and moon have a similar angular size in our sky. It would demand the creation and existence of Earth, humans, and a continuous stream of prerequisites. Any such stream would, ultimately, result in all creation—perhaps even ours. Looking at this universe, I am led to believe that this God may not intend our creation as we experience it. This God is not perfect. This God is not incomprehensible. This God is not alien. This God is human.</p>

            <h3>God is Human</h3>

            <p>A liberal thought would be to say that God is human. Based on our experience of fiction, it is not without merit to assume that the Authorial God created us “in his own image” <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef01a" href="#bibID01">[1]</a>. Perhaps the Abrahamic faith shares certain beliefs with my proposal after all. However, our beliefs diverge when I propose the Authorial God possesses the flaws of humans as well. Beyond it, the Authorial God is an individual that is not solely our God. The Authorial God is another individual just like us. One who lives in a world like ours, spends a life like ours, loves and grows like us.</p>
            <p>One of the major propositions I make based on a human-like God is to reject that there is intended perfect design in our world. Whilst morality and cosmology will be discussed later on, the evolution and specifics of our world can be attributed to a human-like mind. The fallible mind of this God shares aspects with process theology in the sense that the Authorial God grows and learns over time, and they contain this world and its inhabitants in one form or another. However, it still rejects non-temporality, immutability, and impassibility in favour of a mortal, changing, learning, and feeling mind.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this framework allows the equal possibility of multiple Authorial Gods. Creative works are commonly produced by multiple authors. Equally so, many Authorial Gods are capable of contributing to and producing a single narrative structure and world. This introduces further complexity to the exact nature of how the creators’ minds manifest within our world.</p>
            <p>A Panentheist creator holds us in their mind, and creates us with their imagination. I concede that this sounds like something we saw as a five year olds, “the power of imagination” if I dare say so. With this power of imagination, also comes our burden of being its product. The Authorial Gods’ grievances, beliefs, and preferences all alike may manifest in our world. This world may as well be a mode through which our God learns, grows, and heals. Once more, this God resembles a human author as we know it. Our creative writing is informed and influenced by our beliefs, grievances, and convictions. Our narratives too often demand a world extremely similar to ours.</p>

            <h3>Cosmology</h3>

            <p>The cosmological model of the Authorial God is teleological. All creation occurs to serve a narrative purpose. To reiterate, if the Authorial God were to even produce a single creative work, it would demand the creation of a universe to host it. No narrative can simply exist without a universe. This is not supernatural or magical. The mechanics of this creation is entirely compatible with our understanding of Physics, current or future. A teleological creation does not necessarily demand its path to be incompatible with the laws of existence. The Authorial God is an architect. They do not need to know how their designs are constructed, let alone construct it themselves.  Beyond the grand scale of the universe, this narrative intention and its effects are more prominent in the miniscule human scale. Our existence contains many coincidences that often intent is more probable than pure randomness. However, teleology once more does not demand unnatural processes in an otherwise natural universe. I propose that all existence occurred naturally because the Authorial God intended it so—that God’s intent manifests through our existence. Narrative intent and reality supplement, enable, and cause each other in co-dependence.</p>
            <p>It is not far-fetched to propose that the ability of narrative creation extends to us as well. We too are capable of creative thought and hence of divine creation, in an almost Tolkienian process of sub-creation <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef02a" href="#bibID02">[2]</a>. This is not to say that the Authorial God is a God as seen in religion. Rather, it says that there is a recurring stream of Gods begetting worlds and worlds then betting Gods. Authorial Gods are tools of Divine Causality enabling the random and infinite worlds of the Many-worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics—acting as a selective force that defines what can exist and what must exist. Not all possibilities would exist, and some worlds may be the exact same. However, someone somewhere someday will create any given world that would exist. Therein lies the creator and the creation entangled together.</p>
            <p>This cosmology proposes creative narratives as blueprints for present and successive universes. The creator and the creation are both tools of necessity for each other. A universe requires narrative cause to exist, as much as a narrative requires a universe to exist. All universes strive to host and become the narrative they were made to inhabit. It is the nature of all reality to become what they were meant to be.</p>

            <h3>Freewill and Determinism</h3>

            <p>If the physical universe is predetermined to meet certain narrative goals, it is logical to infer a similar framework to the will of its inhabitants. However, this does not necessitate a fully deterministic universe. The system I propose is Compatibilist, mostly resembling Rachel Barr’s “Fishbowl” theory <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef03a" href="#bibID03">[3]</a>. Like Barr’s model, the Authorial God hypothesis imagines free-will as a system of localised and curated choices. Yet, it differs from her theory in one crucial way: the boundaries and constraints of these bubbles are not dependent on the past. Rather, both the past and the present are shaped to serve the Narrative Arc authored by God.</p>
            <p>This universe hosts Local Narrative Systems where individuals experience varying degrees of curated liberties based on their narrative significance. Importantly, one’s freedom is inversely proportional to their narrative significance. The local narrative does evolve; only on the basis of need. I identify four major narrative types: protagonist narratives, supportive narratives, prerequisite narratives, and insignificant narratives.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Protagonist Narratives feature individuals who are directly involved in the Narrative Arc. Their existence is curated to inhabit and live God’s tale for them. Each choice they face, each choice they make is restricted for them to fulfil their purpose. They live the least free lives because they are God’s favourite.</li>
                <li>Supportive Narratives feature individuals that serve a specific purpose in Protagonist Narratives. These narratives vary in liberty, following its proportionality to significance. Their choices too are restricted to serve a particular purpose or role. However, they are only restricted when their actions interact with the Narrative Arc. A small price to be noticed by God.</li>
                <li>Prerequisite Narratives often predate the Protagonist and largely enable the setting and exposition of the Narrative Arc. They are often likely to possess sizable liberties as many prerequisites are often a singular isolated attribute. However, their purpose would then be restricted to few, if not one, choice/s. They are merely the foundation for God’s conscious creations.</li>
                <li>Insignificant Narratives are ones with the greatest liberties as they have insignificant causal effect in the Narrative Arc. They still possess restricted systems; however, even an external observer would not notice any debilitating restrictions. Perhaps being ignored is blissful too.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All beings capable of choice contribute to the construction of the Authorial God’s narratives. It is almost a tithe for being part of this world. One must serve their purpose because that is all they exist for. It is absurd and demotivating to think that lives in this God’s story are reduced to their purpose and many do not hold nearly enough control over their lives as they would want to. However, it is the illusion of choice that keeps all in check. The existence of the Authorial God does not necessitate natural order to be disrupted or altered. Natural order exists such that it enables God’s creation. Their choices are never forced, only naturally restricted. </p>

            <h3>Morality</h3>

            <p>For a universe where both the physical world and the minds of its persons are subject to the will of the greater Narrative Arc, many important questions about morality arise. The most prominent to me is the question of sin: Is it still a sin if God had willed you to do it? Many prominent acts of evil in this world—wars, genocide, starvation, murder, etc—are events that shape most, if not all, lives and narratives of its inhabitants. It is then not without merit to infer that the Authorial God has willed at least some of these events of extreme malice and suffering. If malice and suffering is God’s will, does that imply that God is malevolent?</p>
            <p>Certainly, the Authorial God is capable of malice. However, this is what I call Absent Malevolence. It is not negligence because God never had the capability of knowing that we are being affected in the way we are. It is definitely not active malice because God does not cause suffering because they want to hurt. Absent Malevolence is a narrative device. Something actively used by God as backdrop for their tales, or passively demanded as prerequisites. </p>
            <p>This world complicates the views on sin. Whilst active agency within Local Narratives would allow Intended Sins, sins committed on Narrative Demand bestows sins upon the actor. These Endowed Sins present an ambiguous view on how to interpret sin and its moral implications. It would be unjust and unprovable for a person to claim their sins are Endowed precisely because Narrative Demand cannot be understood fully—especially within the individual scale. </p>
            <p>On an absolute viewpoint, an external viewer may empathise and forgive a character for their actions if they were committed on Narrative Demand. However, their impact within the internal world is still tangible. Selective enforcement of morality and even justice would only undermine the stability of the very institutions that uphold them. Even that, under the assumption of Narrative Demand being understood.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>

            <p>Ultimately, the Authorial God is not a being for worship. Rather, they are a version of divinity that can exist within our current understanding of natural order. The Authorial God does challenge and differ from the Classical God; However, they are a model we can relate to, where God is reconciled with suffering, and God is supranatural yet not incomprehensible. God is not perfect. God was never meant to be.</p>
