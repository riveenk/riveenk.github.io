                <h2 class="body-header">Implications of Buddhism on Political Systems in Sri Lanka</h2>
                <h4 class="body-subheader">16 August, 2025 | Originally an A-Level EPQ Submission</h4>
                
                <p>Buddhism, the state religion of Sri Lanka, has remained entangled in all lives and institutions of
                    Sri
                    Lanka. Historically, royal patronage and religious loyalty have elevated Buddhism to a state of
                    authority. This report examines existing literature, including public opinion, to explore
                    implications
                    of Buddhism on political thought, governance, and authority figures in Sri Lanka. Main findings
                    characterise Buddhist clergy and institutions to be embedded in the Sri Lankan political landscape.
                    They
                    act as informal political advisory bodies, influencing state governance often overruling electoral
                    mandates. Furthermore, Buddhist Nationalist rhetoric significantly shapes public opinion,
                    potentially
                    even causing extremist behaviour. Buddhist symbolism and monastic endorsement also shape electoral
                    support, which is both highly sought after by political leaders and detrimental for non-Buddhist
                    politicians. The uneven power Buddhist figures hold in Sri Lankan politics suggests challenging and
                    hostile social structures towards non-Sinhala-Buddhists. These institutions often propagate messages
                    that are not representative of traditional Buddhist teachings, suggesting that the authority vested
                    in
                    Buddhist figures due to their Buddhist affiliation is misused in Sri Lanka.</p>

                <h5>Research Methodology</h5>
                <p>The research methodology for this paper was developed using the Research "Onion'' Model <a
                        href="#refID01" id="refObj01" class="footerRef">[1]</a> It involves choosing a data collection/
                    analysis method, a
                    time
                    horizon, strategy/ies, methodology, approach to developed theory, and the philosophy. <a
                        class="bibliRef" id="bibRef01a" href="#bibID01">[1]</a>
                    as a framework. Data for this research will be collected mainly through secondary
                    research. This decision was primarily motivated by the difficulty in approaching a large enough
                    sample
                    population for primary data because there is little access to a large enough Sri Lankan population
                    in
                    the accessible vicinity. Furthermore, it has been understood that a significant portion of the
                    intended
                    research material is secondary (for example, government notices, acts of Parliament, news articles)
                    and
                    cannot be replicated via primary research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Owing to the intended evolutionary nature of my research, I would implement a longitudinal study
                    where data will be collected repeatedly over time. However, the research areas will be restricted to
                    ensure that there will not be an overwhelming amount of research to analyse. Although eliminating
                    bias would be challenging, I will add extra care to these decisions to minimise the impact of any
                    potential bias.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the nature of my research demands, the research strategy much resembles a case study approach
                    where I would focus on Sri Lanka. The case study delves into the religious and political makeup of
                    the state while ensuring focus on specific themes (such as extremism, discrimination, political
                    endorsement, and influence on legislature) and entities (such as <i>Bodu Bala Sena</i> and the
                    Temple of the Tooth Relic).
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the implications of Buddhism discussed involve research into specific observations that lead to a
                    final general conclusion, inductive reasoning is applied to the project. I chose an inductive
                    approach as the initial research revealed that the implications of Buddhism are multi-faceted, and
                    applying a deductive approach was more likely to introduce bias, which would ultimately hinder the
                    quality of my final conclusions. Therefore, considering both the context of my project and my
                    expectations of the final outcome, I have decided on an inductive research approach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since my exploration aims at comparing and contrasting Buddhist principles on governance and their
                    actual implementations, critical realism would be a suitable research philosophy to adhere to.
                    Critical Realism is an ontological (philosophical study of being and existence) philosophy that
                    acknowledges the `real' world yet explores the `observable' world accessible to us. This lens would
                    allow me to explore the observable implications of Buddhism on the case studies and the underlying
                    sociopolitical and ethno-cultural dynamics that shape these observations. Hence, I chose critical
                    realism as the research philosophy to effectively approach my research.


                <h5>Introduction</h5>
                <p>Sri Lanka is a Sinhalese-majority South Asian nation with a predominantly Buddhist population <a
                        class="bibliRef" id="bibRef02a" href="#bibID02">[2]</a> census. Its extremely active political
                    landscape has been defined by a series of
                    significant events, including independence from the British Empire (1948), the transition to a
                    republic
                    (1972), and continued political turbulence. Sri Lanka has experienced two failed Marxist uprisings
                    (1971, 1987), a 26-year civil war (1983-2009), anti-Muslim riots (2014, 2018), and terrorist
                    bombings
                    (2019). The mass protests of 2022 led to the resignation of the government, and in 2024, a Communist
                    party-led coalition was elected to the presidency and a parliamentary majority. Amidst this
                    political
                    activity, Buddhism retains a definitive role in Sri Lankan governance. This report critically
                    examines
                    existing literature to explore how varying interpretations of Buddhism shape political thought,
                    governance, and authority figures in Sri Lanka. Through analysis of historical and contemporary
                    influences, it aims to highlight the complex relationship between Buddhism and Sri Lankan politics.
                    Additionally, this report aims to bridge the lack of academic research by Sinhalese authors on this
                    subject, examining how selective interpretations of Buddhism have shaped both public perception and
                    Sri
                    Lanka's political landscape.

                <h5>Buddhist Literature on Governance</h5>
                <p>The Sri Lankan Ministry of Education mandates religious education from Grades (Years) One to Eleven,
                    highlighting its importance. This is an example that demonstrates the symbiosis between Buddhist
                    rationale and government-backed school of thought in Sri Lanka. For Buddhist students, who form a
                    majority of the student population, this ensues eleven years of study of Buddhism in various
                    contexts
                    and lenses: Sinhala Buddhist Literature, National Unity, and even Principles of Governance. I will
                    use
                    the chapters "<i>Raja Bawathu Dammiko</i>'' <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef03a"
                        href="#bibID03">[3]</a> from the Year 9 textbook, and
                    "Buddhist Teachings About State Governance'' <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef04a"
                        href="#bibID04">[4]</a> from the Year 10 textbook, as
                    a
                    structure for this exploration.</p>
                <h6>Ten Royal Virtues</h6>
                <p><i>Dasa-Raja Dharma</i>, or Ten Royal Virtues, are a set of qualities that are prescribed to be held
                    by
                    righteous and just kings. These qualities continue to be used as a standard to uphold the image of a
                    "perfect'' ruler. Particularly in the Birth Stories, royal characters (often a previous birth of the
                    Buddha) demonstrate these virtues to overcome the challenge of the story, examples being the Tale of
                    <i>Nandimiyaga</i> <a class="footerRef" href="#refID02" id="refObj02">[2]</a> and the Tale of
                    <i>Tesakuna</i> <a href="#refID03" id="refObj03" class="footerRef">[3]</a>. This has not only added
                    to the prestige of these standards,
                    but
                    also has deemed them meritorious acts. The virtues are namely <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef03b"
                        href="#bibID03">[3]</a>:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><i>Danam</i> (Charity)</li>
                    <li><i>Silam</i> (Morality)</li>
                    <li><i>Parichchagam</i> (Generosity)</li>
                    <li><i>Ajjavam</i> (Honesty)</li>
                    <li><i>Maddavam</i> (Gentleness)</li>
                    <li><i>Tapam</i> (Self-control)</li>
                    <li><i>Akkodam</i> (Non-anger)</li>
                    <li><i>Avihinsancha</i> (Non-violence)</li>
                    <li><i>Kantheechcha</i> (Patience)</li>
                    <li><i>Avirodanam</i> (Uprightness)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These virtues, owing to both their preaching and the belief of implementation by the Buddha himself,
                    hold significant weight in defining the ideal nature of a ruler. These principles are historically
                    said
                    to have been adhered to by some rulers in many different Buddhist kingdoms, and remain even today,
                    undisputed as a set of reasonable guidelines.</p>

                <h6>Seven Conditions of Welfare </h6>

                <p><i>Saptha Aparihaniya Dharma</i>, or the Seven Conditions of Welfare, is a set of principles that the
                    Buddha is said to have introduced to the Vajji Republic <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef04b"
                        href="#bibID04">[4]</a>, a contemporary
                    aristocratic republic. Their political and sovereign success has been attributed, at least in Sri
                    Lankan
                    belief, to these seven conditions they religiously observed within their governing practices. These
                    conditions are <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef04c" href="#bibID04">[4]</a>:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Convening regularly</li>
                    <li>Convening, discussing, and dispersing peacefully</li>
                    <li>Refraining from imposing previously not imposed (unfair) laws and protecting existing laws</li>
                    <li>Respecting Elders and their opinions</li>
                    <li>Protecting women</li>
                    <li>Protecting religious sites and observing practices without fail</li>
                    <li>Caring for venerable guests of the kingdom</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Similar to the Royal Virtues, these principles are undoubtedly reasonable advice to be followed by a
                    governing body or ruler, albeit with a hint of religious and cultural beliefs. According to the
                    tales,
                    following these conditions has secured great prosperity to the republic, and the beliefs can be
                    attested
                    by historic records. The textbook, too, actively highlights these qualities as ones of a healthy
                    governing system/ body and encourages students to adopt them into their beliefs.</p>

                <h6>Implementation in Sri Lanka</h6>

                <p>Interestingly, these guidelines seem to have influenced political figures to highlight their
                    "Buddhist''
                    identity although their actions may sometimes diverge from it. For instance, many Sri Lankan
                    politicians
                    employ charity as part of their publicity campaigns <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef05a"
                        href="#bibID05">[5]</a> and pay
                    significantly more attention to Buddhist monks and other elders who participate in rallies. A famous
                    quote to illustrate the latter is "<i>ape hamuduruwane</i>'' (transl: "Dear Venerable (monk)''), the
                    address used by Mahinda Rajapaksa, a former president, in many of his rallies <a class="bibliRef"
                        id="bibRef06a" href="#bibID06">[6]</a>,
                    further adding on to his image as being "gentle'' and "moral''. Furthermore, political figures often
                    engage in acts deemed meritorious, particularly during election campaigns <a class="bibliRef"
                        id="bibRef05b" href="#bibID05">[5]</a>, as both a bonding ritual with the population and a
                    display of one's faith.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, despite these attempts, successful and not, to appear more "Buddhist'', there are many
                    instances public knowledge that demonstrate these politicians acting otherwise. We can employ
                    Vasudeva Nanayakkara as an example of how politicians may contrast with the principles of
                    "self-control", "non-anger", and "gentleness". He is almost comically known for his explicit
                    exclamation "<i>pakaya</i>'' <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef7a" href="#bibID07">[7]</a> during a
                    Parliamentary proceeding, towards
                    another parliamentarian.

                    These characters continue to shape the image of Sri Lankan politicians whose actions may diverge
                    significantly from Buddhist principles. Additionally, some of the particular thematic beliefs are
                    specifically significant as they paint an even more diverse yet disturbing picture of the Sri Lankan
                    Buddhist identity. This will be discussed further under our exploration of Political Thought.
                    Likewise, instances of brawls within the Parliament <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef8-1"
                        href="#bibID08">[8]</a>, even escalating
                    to physical violence, continue to show that whilst authority figures in Sri Lanka deliberately
                    acknowledge and attempt these principles, their actions are sometimes perceived and understood to be
                    false. Overall, while Buddhism teaches many positive principles that are even included in the
                    country's school syllabus, political authority figures are often seen to selectively draw on these
                    to only strengthen their public image. At other times, their actions contradict these principles at
                    the expense of the original message, facilitating the emergence of diverging schools of thought that
                    may not represent the traditional interpretations.</p>

                <h5>Buddhist Influence on Political Thought</h5>

                <p>As a state which not only legally recognises Buddhism as the state religion, but also holds a
                    majority
                    Buddhist population whose patriotism is bound to the religion, Sri Lanka is an example of how
                    religious
                    messages may be interpreted differently within political landscapes. Through this exploration, I
                    intend
                    to understand how Buddhism, in its diverse interpreted forms, shapes the political thought of the
                    citizens of the country. As I have shown above, despite inclusion in education, political authority
                    figures continue to act in unfavourable manners, questioning whether the population, too, missed the
                    point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ethno-national identity of Sri Lankan Buddhists manifests itself within legislature, even
                    extending to state recognition and favouritism towards the religion. An introductory viewpoint on
                    the relationship between Buddhism and the Sri Lankan state can be illustrated using Article 9 of the
                    Sri Lankan Constitution <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef09a" href="#bibID09">[9]</a>:</p>



                <p class="quote"> The Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism
                    the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of
                    the State to protect and foster the Buddha <i>Sasana</i>, while
                    assuring to all religions the rights granted by Articles 10
                    and 14(1)(e)
                </p>

                <p>The Sri Lankan state institutionally prioritises Buddhism and actively fosters it. Whilst similar
                    (and
                    more extreme) declarations of favour towards a religion can be found globally, it is interesting to
                    explore Sri Lanka through understanding this information. This is because not only does this
                    declaration
                    hold valuable context, but also this article is used as a reason for much of the Buddhist political
                    thought in Sri Lanka. For example, a 2003 Supreme Court interpretation of Article 9 ruled that "the
                    state is constitutionally required to protect only Buddhism, and other religions do not have the
                    same
                    right to state protection" <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef10a" href="#bibID10">[10]</a> <a
                        class="bibliRef" id="bibRef11a" href="#bibID11">[11]</a> which
                    appears
                    to also be a stance adopted by certain groups justifying the need for state prioritisation of
                    Buddhism
                    in Sri Lanka.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The large overlap between the majority Sinhalese and Buddhist populations was used to kindle the
                    spirit of Sri Lanka's independence movement, and has later evolved into a combined identity of the
                    "Sinhala-Buddhist" <a class="footerRef" href="#refID04" id="refObj04">[4]</a>, deepening the
                    religious divide into an
                    ethno-religious one. This combined identity, characterised with self-praise and xenophobia,
                    highlights the complex political use of Buddhist teachings. Furthermore, this identity is sometimes
                    linked to ethno-religious extremism within specific political ideologies of Sri Lanka. Although a
                    minority within the belief systems of Sri Lanka, they maintain a sizeable impact in their actions.
                    Although Buddhism traditionally teaches to tolerate and coexist with other faiths, some interpret
                    this in ways that lead to discrimination of said faiths as seen within some extremist groups (such
                    as Bodu Bala Sena).

                <h6>Principles of Coexistence</h6>

                <p>Before delving into exploring how differing interpretations manifest within these groups and figures,
                    it
                    is important that we understand what stance Buddhist teachings hold and how they are traditionally
                    interpreted. The <i>Karaneeya Metta Sutra</i> (Discourse on Loving-Compassion) discusses the
                    Buddhist
                    concept of "Loving-Compassion," <a class="footerRef" href="#refID05" id="refObj05">[5]</a> an
                    interesting lens to
                    explore
                    these characters seen in extremist tones. Furthermore, I would explore another lesson from the
                    Buddhism
                    Year 10 syllabus to highlight and discuss how Sri Lankan society is taught to interpret these
                    teachings.</p>

                <p>The lesson <i>Apekama saha Sahajeewanaya</i> (transl: `Our-ness' and Coexistence) introduces the
                    following phrases (translated) <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef04d" href="#bibID04">[4]</a> that are
                    said to be advice from the Buddha:
                </p>
                <p class="quote"> Togetherness is virtuous [...] Reconcile; do not debate
                </p>
                This advice of social unity primarily stems from the general theme of non-violence; however, the social
                connotations of this message can be interpreted to extend to one of coexistence. This idea continues to
                be seen in the Discourse on Loving-Compassion where the Buddha is said to have preached <a
                    class="bibliRef" id="bibRef12a" href="#bibID12">[12]</a>:

                <p class="quote">
                    Let no one deceive another<br>
                    or despise anyone anywhere,<br>
                    or through anger or resistance-perception<br>
                    wish for another to suffer.
                </p>

                <p>This advice can be interpreted to advocate for social unity more directly. As the textbook chapter
                    mentioned above presents (translated), "the Buddha does not approve of approaching others with
                    hatred
                    and unhappiness due to reasons such as religion, race, and caste" <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef04e"
                        href="#bibID04">[4]</a>. These
                    ideas
                    comprise the interpretation that is generally accepted and taught in Sri Lanka.</p>

                <h6>Bodu Bala Sena</h6>

                <p>In contrast, the <i>Bodu Bala Sena</i> (Buddhist Power Army, or BBS) is an ultranationalist
                    Buddhist-supremacist organisation who claims its vision to be the "Protection of Buddhism for Future
                    Generations" <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef13a" href="#bibID13">[13]</a>. This builds onto the
                    "majority-with-minority-complex"
                    perception on the BBS, highlighted by their consistent claims and support for claims such as
                    "non-Buddhists are invading cities" <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef14a" href="#bibID14">[14]</a>
                    or the existence of a
                    "conspiracy to
                    cause the extinction of the Sinhala race" <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef15a"
                        href="#bibID15">[15]</a>
                    bbs-extinct. Though lacking
                    substantiated
                    evidence, the BBS has amassed a sizeable following that actively believes and endorses these claims.
                    These beliefs have, on multiple occasions, led to controversial group activities and further claims
                    that
                    continue the tension within the Sri Lankan community <a class="footerRef" href="#refID06"
                        id="refObj06">[6]</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There have been instances where prominent Buddhist clergy have publicly disowned the views expressed
                    by the BBS. An example of this is Prof. Bellanwila Wimalaratana Thero who has publicly stated that
                    the "views of the Bodu Bala Sena are not the views of the entire Sangha community" <a
                        class="bibliRef" id="bibRef16a" href="#bibID16">[16]</a>. This trend of disowning the
                    beliefs extends to politics as well.
                    Notably, this has led to the BBS being denounced by notable representatives of almost all the
                    political parties. However, the most interesting aspect is public opinion. Public opinion on the BBS
                    is split, polarised, and passionate where some support the nationalist views of the BBS and others
                    denounce its divergence from traditional interpretations of Buddhism. This duality illustrates the
                    influence of extremist Buddhist figures on public opinion. Examples include: <a class="bibliRef"
                        id="bibRef17a" href="#bibID17">[17]</a>:</p>

                <p class="quote">
                    Can you hear the Sinhala sound, you Muslim (derogatory) dogs? [...] Your Allah has not once been on
                    this land, you outsiders (derogatory) (translated)
                </p>

                <p class="quote">
                    Galaboda [<i>sic</i>] seems to be an animal. He can never be a human being.
                </p>

                <p>The exploration into the BBS has allowed us to see how their views differ from traditional Buddhist
                    beliefs. Their continued sizeable support, despite being a minority, has not only been accused of
                    multiple attacks on ethnic-minority groups <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef17b"
                        href="#bibID17">[17]</a><a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef18a" href="#bibID18">[18]</a>, but
                    also acts as a catalyst to explore how varying interpretations of Buddhist teachings affect the
                    political thought of different groups.</p>

                <h6>Controversial Buddhist Figures</h6>

                <p>Within these varying schools of thought on Buddhist governance, many individual monks have attracted
                    controversy around their views and actions as well. Exploring some of these figures and their views
                    would allow me to illustrate how Buddhist authority figures shape and reshape political thought in
                    Sri
                    Lanka. However, an important prerequisite is understanding that some of these controversial figures
                    do
                    not align with the traditional interpretations of Buddhism mentioned above.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Battaramulle Seelarathana thero exemplifies the controversy surrounding clergy in Sri Lankan
                    politics. As a recurring candidate in Sri Lanka's Presidential Elections, he has characterised that
                    "it has always been a monk that saved the country" (translated) and that a "layman ruler can never
                    care for the country more than a monk" (translated) <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef19a"
                        href="#bibID19">[19]</a>. However, he
                    also claims that "you cannot fix a country with religion" (translated) <a class="bibliRef"
                        id="bibRef19b" href="#bibID19">[19]</a>
                    questioning the legitimacy of his political aims. The controversy around Seelarathana
                    extends into his racist remarks, involvement in politics, and the often unorthodox presence. In
                    multiple public interviews, he has expressed views against minority groups. He claims that Muslim
                    and Tamil political parties are racist <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef19c" href="#bibID19">[19]</a>
                    , that rulers favour the
                    Muslim population <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef20a" href="#bibID20">[20]</a>, and calls for
                    Sinhala people to protest against
                    some Muslim politicians <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef20b" href="#bibID20">[20]</a>. These
                    views illustrate a continued
                    majority with a minority complex within some Buddhist figures. His favourable policy towards the
                    recreational use of Cannabis, both illegal <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef21a"
                        href="#bibID21">[21]</a>
                    and considered sinful <a href="#refID07" id="refObj07" class="footerRef">[7]</a> has
                    attracted controversy and public
                    ridicule. These factors
                    erode both his political aims and the broader legitimacy of clergy in politics due to misalignment
                    between his policies and traditional Buddhist teachings and resulting public ridicule for his
                    statements.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Whilst Seelarathana's controversy mainly stemmed from his eccentric demeanour and political
                    aspirations, Galagodatthe Gnanasara thero's controversy stems from his radical ethno-nationalist
                    rhetoric. In a rally, often blamed for inciting the 2014 anti-Muslim riots, Gnanasara addresses a
                    roaring and cheering crowd. He says that they "still have a Sinhala Police, a Sinhala Army" <a
                        class="bibliRef" id="bibRef17c" href="#bibID17">[17]</a> and threatens that if "even one Muslim
                    (derogatory) or another outsider
                    (derogatory) lays a hand on a Sinhalese [...] it will be the end of them all" <a class="bibliRef"
                        id="bibRef17d" href="#bibID17">[17]</a>. Such rhetoric exemplifies how Buddhist figures can
                    diverge from traditional Buddhist
                    teachings and yet be met with social approval. Gnanasara openly affirmed, "yes, we are racist," <a
                        class="bibliRef" id="bibRef17e" href="#bibID">[17]</a> illustrating the overt ethno-religious
                    rhetoric invoked in some
                    nationalist Buddhist movements. Despite this, it is clear that Gnanasara and similar personalities
                    hold not only a sizeable public following but also complicity from the ruling factions. The latter
                    is illustrated better by the Presidential Pardon granted to him by President Sirisena when he was
                    arrested for contempt of court <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef22a" href="#bibID22">[22]</a>. This
                    continues to show that
                    controversial Buddhist figures experience a range in public reception yet hold influence over public
                    sentiment.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, we can see that diverging Buddhist schools of thought continue to interpret and adopt the
                    Buddhist identity via ethnic and legal lenses. Whilst this is perceived and accepted by the
                    population in varying ways, some who adopt extremist interpretations and identity can be associated
                    more with protesting and violent political thought. These cases exemplify the evolving role of
                    Buddhist clergy in Sri Lankan political thought, where they simultaneously command public support
                    while diverging from traditional Buddhist teachings. This trend raises important questions about how
                    religious authority and political power shape national policies.</p>

                <h5>Buddhist Influence on State Governance</h5>

                <p>Since ancient times, the Buddhist <i>Sangha</i> has advised rulers and influenced state governance.
                    This
                    trend continues to the present where Buddhist clergy remain influential in the country's governance,
                    particularly the <i>Maha Sangha</i> (Great Clergy) who are senior clergy from the major orders of
                    Sri
                    Lanka. This further illustrates the reverence of Buddhist authority figures within advisory roles
                    for
                    state governance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whilst they are not officially appointed, they are often consulted and informed of state decisions,
                    further highlighting the power they hold. Through this exploration, I aim to understand how Buddhist
                    authority figures, especially of varying schools of thought, influence state affairs and decisions
                    of the government. These political roles influence political thought, state governance, and beyond.
                    Additionally, these figures often advocate for certain policies and engage in protests themselves.
                </p>

                <h6>Consultative Role</h6>

                <p>The <i>Mahasangha</i>, a community of monks representing monastic lineages of Sri Lanka, continues to
                    serve as an advisory body. Collectively and severally, political figures often consult and heed the
                    advice of this loosely defined group <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef23a" href="#bibID23">[23]</a> <a
                        class="bibliRef" id="bibRef24a" href="#bibID24">[24]</a>. Despite their
                    informal authority, members of the <i>Maha Sangha</i> frequently hold advisory roles within the
                    government. By exploring the <i>Maha Sangha</i>'s involvement in state affairs, public statements,
                    and
                    official appointments, I aim to illustrate the nature of their consultative role.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, these appointments are not without controversy. The <i>Maha Sangha</i> faces criticism for
                    its involvement in politics and their divisive rhetoric. For instance, Vendaruwe Upali thero, Deputy
                    Chief Incumbent of the Asgiri Chapter <a class="footerRef" href="#refID08" id="refObj08">[8]</a>,
                    advised President
                    Gotabaya Rajapaksa to "be a Hitler and build the country if they call [him] a Hitler" (translated)
                    and suggested that military rule may be necessary to "fix the country" (translated) <a
                        class="bibliRef" id="bibRef25a" href="#bibID25">[25]</a>. Public reaction to this is deeply
                    polarised, with some expressing
                    passionate support and others strong criticism <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef25a"
                        href="#bibID25">[25]</a> <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef26a" href="#bibID26">[26]</a>:</p>

                <p class="quote">

                </p>

                <p>These reactions illustrate the divided public opinion regarding the <i>Maha Sangha</i>’s role in
                    politics. This reflects broader tensions in Sri Lanka’s religious-political discourse. Upali's
                    opinion
                    reflects Seelarathana's view of “you cannot fix a country with religion” as "a Hitler" is not a
                    metaphor
                    indicative of "a leadership bound with Buddhism" <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef25a"
                        href="#bibID25">[25]</a>. Overall, such
                    controversy
                    highlights the differences between traditional Buddhist teachings and the political advice of the
                    <i>Maha Sangha</i> suggesting varying beliefs.

                    Beyond informal advice, the <i>Maha Sangha</i> is also offered direct government appointment. In
                    2022, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa appointed a Presidential Task Force (PTF) for the "implementation
                    of the concept; one country, one law" <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef27a" href="#bibID27">[27]</a>,
                    in
                    reference to the mixture of
                    Roman-Dutch Law, English Common Law, and three customary legal systems <a class="footerRef"
                        href="#refID09" id="refObj09">[9]</a> within Sri Lankan law. Galagodatthe Gnanasara thero,
                    introduced earlier, was
                    appointed chairman of this PTF <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef27b" href="#bibID27">[27]</a>. Whilst
                    the contents of the final report of
                    the task force are unavailable for public access <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef28a"
                        href="#bibID28">[28]</a>, the principle behind
                    its inception and appointment of Gnanasara has invited further polarised discourse among the public
                    <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef29b" href="#bibID29">[29]</a>. Despite controversy, figures like
                    Gnanasara continue to receive
                    government appointments, reinforcing the <i>Maha Sangha</i>'s enduring institutional legitimacy in
                    Sri Lankan governance.

                <h6>Military Advocacy and History</h6>

                <p>The first of the Five Precepts prohibits killing <a class="footerRef" href="#refID10"
                        id="refObj10">[10]</a>. Yet,
                    historical and modern events, such as the Battle of <i>Vijithapura</i> and the Sri Lankan Civil War,
                    demonstrate how military action has been justified to protect Buddhism. Interpretations vary; while
                    some
                    support strict non-violence, others justify military action under specific justifications. For
                    instance,
                    the Sri Lankan defence of Japan <a class="footerRef" href="#refID11" id="refObj11">[11]</a> during
                    the 1952 San
                    Francisco
                    Treaty Conference, quoted below, exemplifies an emphasis on <i>ahimsa</i>, non-violence:</p>
                <p class="quote">
                    ...we believe in the words of the Great Teacher (the Buddha) [...] that `hatred ceases not by hatred
                    but by love'.
                </p>

                <p>Buddhist influence on war varies between traditional interpretations and mytho-historical portrayals,
                    particularly the <i>Mahavansa</i>. <i>Mahavansa</i> tales are frequently invoked in political
                    rhetoric
                    to justify military action as a means to protect Buddhism, reinforcing the Sinhala-Buddhist
                    identity.
                    Examples include tales of the Buddha "[striking] terror to [non-Buddhist demons'] hearts" suggesting
                    that even the Buddha sanctioned the use of terror towards non-Buddhists <a class="bibliRef"
                        id="bibRef30a" href="#bibID30">[30]</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Battle of <i>Vijithapura</i> was a historic battle between Sinhalese king Dutugamunu and Tamil
                    king Ellalan. The primary motive of this war was to allow Dutugamunu "to establish the doctrine of
                    the [Buddha]" <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef30b" href="#bibID30">[30]</a>. The <i>Mahavansa</i>
                    also praises Ellalan, that he ruled
                    with "even justice toward friend and foe," and once begged to be executed for injuring a Buddhist
                    place of worship. <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef30c" href="#bibID30">[30]</a>. Ironically, in the
                    aftermath of the war, an
                    <i>Arhat</i> reassures Dutugamunu that he is free of sin as those he slaughtered were "not more to
                    be esteemed than beasts" <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef30d" href="#bibID30">[30]</a>. This
                    narrative frames military action as
                    religious duty for the protection of Buddhism, and frames non-Buddhists as demonic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <i>Mahavansa</i>'s depiction of all of Dutugamunu's enemies as "<i>Damilas</i>" <a
                        href="#refID12" id="refObj12" class="footerRef">[12]</a> almost characterising Tamil people as
                    an enemy of the
                    Sinhalese <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef30e" href="#bibID30">[30]</a>. has been referenced in
                    modern nationalistic sentiment,
                    reinforcing narratives that justified ethnic tensions during the Sri Lankan Civil War. Field Marshal
                    Sarath Fonseka, a military commander during the war, reinforces these parallels by claiming that the
                    Sri Lankan Army "repeated King Dutugamunu’s feats at Vijithapura" <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef31a"
                        href="#bibID31">[31]</a>. Thus,
                    whilst traditional interpretations advocate non-violence, the <i>Mahavansa</i> shapes nationalistic
                    interpretations, influencing modern and historic political decisions. This demonstrates how Buddhist
                    narratives, particularly the <i>Mahavansa</i>, remain political instruments, legitimising state
                    actions even when contradicting traditional Buddhist principles.</p>

                <h6>Buddhist Protest</h6>

                <p>Extending beyond military engagement, Buddhist authority figures have shaped protest in modern-day
                    Sri
                    Lanka. Driven by the strong Buddhist involvement during Sri Lanka's independence movement, Buddhist
                    figures continue to engage in protest to express discontent, sometimes violently. A historical
                    example
                    is Wariyapola Sri Sumangala thero who is known for taking down the Union Jack and hoisting the
                    Sinhalese
                    flag just before control of the Kandyan Kingdom was ceded to the British Crown. Such acts of
                    rebellion
                    have informed and facilitated the modern forms of protest among Buddhist figures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While many protests are symbolic, some have taken extreme paths, including acts of violence. A
                    notable example of this is the assassination of S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike <a class="footerRef"
                        href="#refID13" [ ] id="refObj13">[13]</a>, then Prime Minister of Ceylon, by Talduwe Somarama
                    Thero. Somarama's
                    confession <a class="footerRef" href="#refID14" id="refObj14">[14]</a> and criminal investigations
                    led to conspiracy
                    charges on Mapitigama Buddharakkitha Thero among six others <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef32a"
                        href="#bibID32">[32]</a>. Both monks
                    were convicted; Somarama was executed by hanging and Buddharakkitha was imprisoned for life <a
                        href="#refID15" id="refObj15" class="footerRef">[15]</a>. Further in Somarama's confession, he
                    says that
                    Buddharakkitha said "that Bandaranaike had to be killed in order to save the country, race and
                    religion" <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef32b" href="#bibID32">[32]</a>. This illustrates both the
                    depth of political concern among
                    Buddhists and the involvement of Buddhist clergy within it. Despite the Buddhist prohibition on
                    killing, some Buddhist figures have justified violence for nationalistic aims.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A modern, less-violent example is some factions of the <i>Aragalaya</i> (transl. Struggle) protest
                    series targeted against the government. Owing to the decentralised political efforts of the series,
                    a homogenous belief was not apparent beyond the primary aim. This led to Buddhist beliefs to emerge
                    once more in protests. Koswatte Mahanama Thero, a protester in <i>Aragalaya</i>, is an example who
                    opposes the government as "[the rulers] don’t live by the precepts of Buddhism" <a class="bibliRef"
                        id="bibRef33a" href="#bibID33">[33]</a> citing corruption. Whilst concerns of divisive sentiment
                    have been raised <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef34a" href="#bibID34">[34]</a>, the principle of
                    Buddhist clergy
                    assuming a "guardian role to
                    protect the people of Sri Lanka" <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef35b" href="#bibID35">[35]</a>
                    aragalaya-1
                    has been reaffirmed. The subsequent
                    success of the protest series, whilst not fully credited to Buddhist forces, highlights their
                    growing active involvement in Sri Lankan protest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These examples demonstrate the continued evolution of Buddhist protest from a persistent political
                    force to even include forms of violent extremism. Buddhist figures continue to shape and reshape the
                    political landscape of Sri Lanka. Beyond their official and unofficial influence, these figures
                    actively pursue political aims via protest. This increasingly dominant force is often remembered for
                    its adverse effects, and continues to incite deep divisions in public sentiment. This analysis
                    illustrates how Buddhism remains strongly interwoven with Sri Lankan state governance, legitimising
                    its policies and protest. Whilst some advocate traditional principles, others use militarism and
                    nationalism, exemplifying their role in state governance.</p>

                <h5>Buddhist Influence on Authority Figures</h5>
                <p>Beyond directly political roles, Buddhist figures indirectly shape Sri Lankan authority through
                    endorsement and constructing legitimacy via Buddhist affiliation and symbolism. The reverence
                    attached
                    to these figures, reinforced by their influence over the Sinhala-Buddhist majority, ensures that
                    this
                    influence remains crucial within Sri Lanka's evolving political landscape.</p>

                <h6>Endorsing Authority Figures</h6>

                <p>The relic of the tooth of the Buddha has historically been used as a source of divine legitimacy to
                    rule
                    Sri Lanka. Since its acquisition by the Sinhalese Monarchy, close patronage of the relic led it to
                    be
                    enshrined as a royal symbol. The relic has been housed and rehoused near the royal palace for the
                    entirety of its future until its current housing in the Royal Palace Complex of the Kandyan Kingdom.
                    Whilst colonial rule disrupted its direct role in legitimising sovereignty, its role has evolved as
                    a
                    source of blessing for incumbent leaders. This is illustrated by the traditional visits to the
                    Temple of
                    the Tooth by newly elected/ appointed authority figures, such as Presidents <a class="bibliRef"
                        id="bibRef36a" href="#bibID36">[36]</a> <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef37a"
                        href="#bibID37">[37]</a><a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef38a" href="#bibID38">[38]</a>. While not
                    legally mandated, this is an important public bonding ritual to signify political legitimacy to
                    Buddhist
                    voters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since independence from the British Crown in 1948, every executive leader has been Buddhist (by
                    birth or converted) <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef39a" href="#bibID39">[39]</a>, illustrating a
                    <i>de facto</i> political
                    exclusivity, reinforced by Buddhist monastic endorsements and Sinhala-majority voter preferences.
                    Whilst minority candidates have occasionally succeeded in local elections, the absence of
                    non-Buddhist executive leaders illustrates systemic barriers to minority representation, raising
                    questions about political inclusivity. Their limited electability suggests restrictive voter
                    preferences, limiting electoral demographics, and Buddhist-nationalist rhetoric. This exclusivity is
                    reinforced as political parties rarely nominate non-Buddhist candidates for executive roles, and
                    many minority candidates apply independently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the 2024 Presidential Elections, Buddhist institutions, including Chief Incumbent of the
                    Mihintale Raja Maha Vihara <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef40a" href="#bibID40">[40]</a> and
                    the National Bhikkhu Front <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef41a" href="#bibID41">[41]</a>, publicly
                    endorsed prominent candidates such as Anura Dissanayake and
                    Sajith Premadasa. These endorsements took the form of temple events, televised statements by senior
                    monks, and campaign appearances <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef41b" href="#bibID41">[41]</a><a
                        class="bibliRef" id="bibRef42a" href="#bibID42">[42]</a>,
                    reinforcing their appeal among Sinhala-Buddhist voters.
                    As illustrated earlier, these incentivise political figures to explicitly incorporate traditional
                    Buddhist virtues into their campaign identities. Furthermore, this religious exclusivity shapes the
                    Sri Lankan populist rhetoric exemplified by controversial religious figures such as Gnanasara thero
                    and Seelarathana thero <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef19d" href="#bibID19">[19]</a> <a
                        class="bibliRef" id="bibRef20c" href="#bibID20">[20]</a> <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef17f"
                        href="#bibID17">[17]</a> as well as political figures such as Sajith Premadasa <a
                        class="bibliRef" id="bibRef43a" href="#bibID43">[43]</a>, deepening religious polarity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite Sri Lanka's multi-religious society, non-Buddhist presidential candidates face unfair
                    political competition, increasing systemic disadvantages to their electability. The 2024 elections
                    saw only five candidates of minority background—three Tamil, two Muslim—out of thirty-nine
                    candidates, who collectively only secured 1.87% of the national vote <a class="bibliRef"
                        id="bibRef44a" href="#bibID44">[44]</a> 2024-PrE.
                    While historic regional voting patterns indicate stronger support for Tamil and Muslim candidates in
                    the Northern and Eastern provinces, national electoral politics remain heavily dominated by
                    Sinhala-Buddhist candidates, discouraging non-Buddhist political participation at higher levels <a
                        href="#refID16" id="refObj16" class="footerRef">[16]</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The intersection of legitimacy, monastic endorsement and the nationalist rhetoric of politicians
                    continues to influence Sri Lankan political competition. This religiously driven electoral
                    exclusivity significantly reduces non-Buddhist candidates' electability compared to their Sinhalese
                    counterparts and diminishes their influence, affecting political inclusivity, minority
                    representation, and the democratic landscape of Sri Lanka. While Buddhism remains a cultural
                    influence, its relevance in state politics raises concern about Sri Lanka's future pluralistic
                    governance. Whilst some political movements advocate for inclusivity, the Buddhist identity embedded
                    in electoral politics suggests significant barriers against minority candidates at the national
                    level with an ambiguous image of the future.</p>

                <h6>Relationship with Authority Figures</h6>
                <p>
                    Many newly elected executives take office amid the chanting of <i>Jaya Mangala Gatha</i>, seeking
                    divine blessing for a new term. Beyond such symbolism, the relationship of political figures and
                    Buddhist figures can elevate or condemn authority figures. As discussed earlier, they maintain a
                    powerful consultative and protest-driven role in Sri Lankan politics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given the <i>Sangha</i>'s immense influence, many politicians seek their support and approval. In
                    some instances, authority figures appease the <i>Sangha</i>, even at the expense of their electoral
                    promises. Maithripala Sirisena, former President, sought modernising constitutional reforms but
                    interestingly faced unanimous opposition from the <i>Mahanayaka</i> theros <a class="bibliRef"
                        id="bibRef45a" href="#bibID45">[45]</a>. Despite public support for reform <a class="footerRef"
                        href="#refID17" id="refObj17">[17]</a>, Buddhist
                    clergy overruled the proposal, highlighting their authority over executive decisions. It is striking
                    that Buddhist clergy, traditionally viewed as embodying loving-compassion, opposed legislation aimed
                    to foster communal harmony <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef46a" href="#bibID46">[46]</a>,
                    illustrating the <i>Sangha</i>'s continued

                    highlights how politicians adjust political aims and policy to secure Buddhist
                    approval. These cases highlight how authority figures prioritise Buddhist approval over voter
                    preferences and broader social coexistence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whilst many politicians support Buddhist institutions, others have opposed some of its actions.
                    Former Finance Minister, Mangala Samaraweera, is an example of such opposition. He openly criticised
                    Warakagoda Gnanaratha thero who claimed that Muslims do not love Sinhala-Buddhists and suggested
                    that such "traitors" should be "stoned to death" (translated) <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef48a"
                        href="#bibID48">[48]</a> stone-them.
                    Samaraweera responded by urging Buddhists to reject the "Talibanization" of the religion and
                    denounced "robed orders" promoting violence <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef49a"
                        href="#bibID49">[49]</a>
                    mangala-responds. While these remarks
                    gained him praise from minority communities <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef50a"
                        href="#bibID50">[50]</a>
                    mangala-praised, they also led to his
                    exclusion in public events <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef51a" href="#bibID51">[51]</a>
                    mangala-excluded and
                    branding as
                    anti-Sinhala-Buddhist. His political life illustrates how opposing the views of the <i>Sangha</i>
                    will marginalise authority figures. The fusion of Buddhism and monastic authority grants Buddhist
                    figures unofficial immunity from criticism, discouraging opposition. This suggests a perception that
                    to challenge clergy is to challenge Buddhism itself, which continues to shape the Sri Lankan
                    political landscape.</p>
                <p>

                    Overall, many political authority figures maintain a careful relationship with Buddhism at the risk
                    of marginalisation if otherwise. The perceived equivalence between Buddhism and Buddhist clergy
                    reinforces the costly repercussions of opposition, facilitating the <i>Sangha</i> to express and
                    endorse views freely. The need to appease the Sinhala-Buddhist majority, who hold the <i>Sangha</i>
                    as both advisors and community leaders, forces authority figures to coddle Buddhist institutions for
                    political stability.</p>

                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                <p>
                    Despite diverse interpretations, there is a clear understanding and access to traditional Buddhist
                    teachings in Sri Lanka. These interpretations often manifest themselves in mythology,
                    ethno-nationalism, and forms of protest. Though both forms influence political thought, governance,
                    and authority figures, extremist interpretations tend to resonate more strongly with segments of the
                    population. These circumstances often create a hostile environment for religious and ethnic
                    minorities in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, traditional teachings are often sidelined in favour of
                    political expediency, undermining social coexistence. Authority figures maintain a range of opinions
                    on Buddhist rhetoric, even as they often invoke or benefit from it. Ultimately, modern Buddhist
                    rhetoric remains deeply interwoven with Sri Lankan politics, influencing its path in both subtle and
                    overt ways. This suggests that modern political implications of Buddhism significantly deviate from
                    traditional teachings, raising concern about certain Buddhist figures misusing Buddhist symbols,
                    institutions, and authority.</p>
