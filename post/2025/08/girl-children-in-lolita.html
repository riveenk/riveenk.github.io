                    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">In Nabokov’s Lolita <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef01a"
                            href="#bibID01">[1]</a>, readers are presented with Humbert Humbert, who
                        grooms and eventually rapes Dolores Haze, his “Lolita”. Despite his regret of the “foul lust
                        [he] had inflicted upon [her],” and Dr. John Ray’s denouncement of Humbert as “horrible [and]
                        abject,” in the preface, the social perception of Dolores and the “girl-children” is far from
                        being absolved. Bertens <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef02a" href="#bibID02">[2]</a> argues that
                        one of the “cultural stereotypes” imposed on female
                        characters is, the “immoral and dangerous seductress”. This is true for Lolita and the
                        “nymphets”, created by both Humbert and society. However, not necessarily for Dolores and the
                        “girl-children”, created by Nabokov. The modern definition of the word "Lolita" is
                        defined as “a sexually precocious young girl” <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef03a"
                            href="#bibID03">[3]</a>, despite the
                        clear indication within the text that Dolores was a child who was being raped. Furthermore,
                        Dolores being labelled “vulgar” <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef04a" href="#bibID04">[4]</a>, and
                        a “corrupt child” <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef05a" href="#bibID05">[5]</a> shows
                        how the initial reception of Lolita reflects the modern dictionary definition. Up until the
                        modern
                        day, both the sexually suggestive and erotic covers in various Lolita texts <a class="bibliRef"
                            id="bibRef06a" href="#bibID06">[6]</a>, as well as the fiction genre of lolicon show that
                        this victimised child continues to be
                        seen as a femme fatale <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef07a" href="#bibID07">[7]</a>, who took
                        advantage of a “weak adult” <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef05c" href="#bibID05">[5]</a>. However,
                        it will be argued that “Lolita” and “nymphets” are only illusions made by
                        Humbert to justify his crimes, and that the “girl-children” are victims, not
                        “seductress[es]”—they are “girl-children, not starlets and ‘sex kittens’,” <a class="bibliRef"
                            id="bibRef08a" href="#bibID08">[8]</a>.</p>

                    <p>Throughout the novel, Nabokov characterises Humbert as a dangerously likeable character who
                        abuses his charm to misuse society's trust in him and engage in his “monstrous
                        indulgence[s].” This extends beyond the novel’s characters, to affect the readers as well, via
                        Humbert’s narrative voice. The explicit honesty in revealing his “localised
                        lust” invites the reader to accept Humbert’s opinion and excuse him, being his “jury”, as not “a
                        cunning adult [but] a weak adult [exploited] by a corrupt child” <a class="bibliRef"
                            id="bibRef05d" href="#bibID05">[5]</a>. Nabokov
                        employs unreliable narration to mimic the manipulative case Humbert presents to us, which
                        appeals to the reader to accept his morally degenerate ideas in a strangely romanticised way.
                        Through the momentary reveals of his honest self, Humbert simplifies and normalises his “moral
                        leprosy” in the eyes of the reader, effectively creating a case attempting to justify his
                        hebephilia and frame himself as an “anguished [...] man [...] who can love only little girls”
                        <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef04b" href="#bibID04">[4]</a>. This form of “bonding unreliability”
                        <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef09a" href="#bibID09">[9]</a> shows us how Humbert traps
                        the mind of some readers with his “seductive self-justification of skilful rhetoric” <a
                            class="bibliRef" id="bibRef10a" href="#bibID10">[10]</a>, pushing them to “identify Humbert
                        with the author more than Nabokov intends” <a class="bibliRef" id="bibRef10a"
                            href="#bibID10">[10]</a>. Understanding this allows us to see that Humbert’s likeability is
                        a warning—“he is a
                        shining example of moral leprosy”—by Nabokov, not a justification of Humbert’s twisted views on
                        “girl-children”.
                    </p>

                    <p>For the entirety of Lolita, Humbert’s narrative tends to be unclear, cloudy or even
                        victim-blaming whenever there is sexual contact, private fantasy, or revelation of Dolores’
                        victimhood. For instance, when Humbert rubs his genitals on Dolores (1.13), Nabokov constructs
                        Humbert’s narrative to focus on Dolores’ unknowing actions during the molestation—“every
                        movement she made, every shuffle and ripple”—as blameworthy instead of himself, as well as
                        camouflage his disgusting orgasm on a 13-year old child: “all of a sudden a mysterious change
                        came over [his] senses [... his] innermost roots became a glowing tingle”. This continued
                        misrepresentation of Dolores’ involvement in her rape builds on the social concept developed by
                        the reader to view Lolita as “a sexually precocious young girl” <a class="bibliRef"
                            id="bibRef03b" href="#bibID03">[3]</a>, and Humbert as a “weak adult” <a class="bibliRef"
                            id="bibRef05c" href="#bibID05">[5]</a> who is taken advantage of. For much disgust, this
                        pattern continues with other unsuspecting girl-children who are merely acting with childhood
                        innocence. In Part 1 Chapter 5, even as a young girl—whom Humbert calls a “perfect little
                        beauty”—tightens her roller skates, Nabokov presents how Humbert “dissolve[s] in the sun”, and
                        worse, experiences an erection that he covers “with [his] book for fig leaf”, demonstrating both
                        Humbert’s depravity and censorship via “fancy prose style” throughout his confession. Humbert
                        continues to present the girl-children in a manner of active promiscuity—“dip[ped] her slim bare
                        arms into [him], “[a] school girl hung over [him]”—assigning an active role to them in these
                        “one-sided diminutive romances” of Humbert seeking “lone gratification” watching children play,
                        stand, or undress. </p>

                    <p>While highlighting Humbert’s iniquity, Nabokov differentiates Humbert’s “Lolita” from the real
                        Dolores Haze, even presenting Humbert with multiple opportunities to stop his crimes. Humbert
                        refers to Dolores with “Lo”/ “Lolita”, “Dolly”, and “Dolores” to present the same victimised
                        child through different lenses, most delusional. He tells the reader that Lolita “seduced” him,
                        despite his initial complaint—“Oh, Lolita, had you loved me thus!” (1.4)—and later confesses
                        that “there were times when [he] knew how [Dolores] felt” (2.32). His “calculated carnality”
                        elects to ignore Dolores' “helplessness” despite his awareness of his crimes committed against
                        her. Furthermore, he admits that he “simply did not know a thing about [Dolores’] mind” (2.32)
                        allowing Nabokov to demonstrate to us that the construct of Lolita holds no material resemblance
                        to Dolores. Nabokov extends this effort to cleverly demonstrate the real Dolores Haze, via some
                        of the handful of instances Humbert refers to her by Dolores: “taking things off a clothesline”
                        (1.11), “consuming a wedge of pie, with her eyes fixed on her script” (2.14). These depict a
                        child, one that was raped, nevertheless a child. Humbert’s control over the narrative we access
                        allows him to exercise far more than just aesthetic liberty—he destroys and hides Dolores in the
                        meek corners of a line of dialogue or a loose frame of Dolores’ real life. Additionally, we see
                        that Dolores struggles with sexual maturity and behaviour at school as Ms Pratt introduces.
                        Nabokov uses the Freudian psychosexual theory—“She is still shuttling [...] between the anal and
                        genital zones of development” (2.11)—to both subvert contemporary child blame for incest via
                        Freud’s theory and demonstrate the psychological distress impressed on Dolores by Humbert.
                        Through these, Nabokov intends to warn his readers of the dangerous depraved adults like Humbert
                        who delude themselves and society with false sincerity and victimhood, leaving behind a trail of
                        children blamed for being raped.</p>

                    <p>Humbert’s greatest defence against his hebephilia is the claim of the girl children’s complicity
                        in these actions—active involvement even. However, throughout the text, Nabokov presents three
                        methods Humbert employs; none are mutually consensual: voyeurism, money, and threat. “[From
                        Humbert’s] balcony [he] would notice [...] what looked like a nymphet in the act of undressing”
                        (1.5). This is a perfect example of Humbert’s voyeurism. Even Humbert never produces an excuse
                        for this act, as Nabokov employs this to show that some actions cannot be defended even by the
                        morally degenerate. Money: Beyond Humbert’s liberal association with prostitutes—Monique, among
                        others—he extends this to "Dolly" whom he pays “sixty-five cents plus the permission to
                        participate in the school play” (2.11) to masturbate him at school. This serves to show how
                        derogatory Humbert evolves during his prolonged rape of Dolores, even caricaturing her repressed
                        helpless life into one that of a prostitute. However, Nabokov highlights Dolores’ actual stance
                        on her relationship via her casual accusations (“the hotel where you raped me”, 2.13) and overt
                        disapproval (“for Christ’s sake leave me alone”, 2.10). Despite this, Humbert controls and
                        threatens Dolores against revealing his crimes: “I go to jail. But what happens to you, my
                        orphan?” (1.1) and “I am ready to yank you out of Beardsley and lock you up you know where”
                        (2.14). These threats, along with fierce lines of interrogation, social restriction, and general
                        theft of childhood allow Humbert to continue his abuse on Dolores. Not her
                        complicity. Nabokov makes Humbert justify himself with reasons that he will disprove. These
                        reasons remain the only accusation against girl-children, yet they fail so easily by the words
                        of
                        the accuser himself.</p>

                    <p>Despite Nabokov’s overt intention to denounce men like Humbert in Lolita, he creates a man so
                        convincingly real that readers accept him by the end of the book, where his crimes are more
                        apparent. The reader has to consciously read between Humbert’s exceptionally long and complex
                        sentences, garnished with French and false romantics. Humbert weaponises his partial honesty to
                        make the reader believe him, empathise with him, and reduce Dolores to Lolita, and girl-children
                        to nymphets. He actively neglects Dolores’ well-being in favour of his sexual gratification,
                        leading to her psychological, social, and academic deterioration. Humbert’s coercive and
                        manipulative actions have affected Dolores’ life in many horrible ways. Nabokov excellently
                        crafts a character that somehow holds a mind of its own, tricks its readers, and eventually
                        becomes an immoral and dangerous seducer. A reader would either see Humbert coercively seducing
                        Dolores or be seduced by Humbert themselves.</p>
