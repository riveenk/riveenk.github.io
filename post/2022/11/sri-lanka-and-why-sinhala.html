        <p>Hello everyone, welcome again. This post would be the pilot of the Sinhala
            Language and Culture series. This post will cover your basic questions when
            accessing this series. First of all, the best perk is that this is free and made
            by myself (a native speaker) and proofread through professional teaching
            content.</p>
            <p>
              <b>So, the first big question is: What is Sri Lanka?</b> Sri Lanka is a
              beautiful island nation to the south of India (No we aren't part of India).
              Home to a culture that runs over 2000 years to the past rich with many
              cultural elements shaped through the different races, faiths and people living
              together. Perhaps a country you saw in the headlines a few months ago.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Secondly: Why Sri Lanka?</b> Sri Lankan history is as rich as Egypt and
              Babylon; It's a culture that is unique in its own way. With rapid
              globalisation, we see the Sri Lankan factor slowly dissolving out of society.
              Similar to how people are intrigued by the wonders of the famous cultures, I
              hope to show the world that Sri Lanka is a better place worth investing your
              time to learn about.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Thirdly: Why Sinhala? </b>Sinhala to the close observer can be the most
              intriguing language in the world. Also, Sinhala is a direct descendant of one
              of the oldest languages in the world, Sanskrit. Also, given the rich sounds in
              Sinhala, when familiar, you're a winner in pronouncing that hard word next
              time.
            </p>
            <h3 style="text-align: left;">What Sri Lanka truly is</h3>
            <p>
              To a quick glance, Sri Lanka only looks a country in economic downfall and
              political turmoil; but if you look closer, you will see a country worth
              visiting and loving. Sri Lanka boasts a wide range of topography, climate and
              attractions inside the little island. Cold to hot, we have options: Kandy to
              Jaffna. Tasty food and lovely people; food rich in taste and people rich by
              heart.
            </p>
            <p>
              A country who has a mad craze for cricket, and home to Sri Lanka cricket. A
              country that gets you the Spices, Tea and Coconut: the home to cinnamon and
              Ceylon Tea.&nbsp;
            </p>
