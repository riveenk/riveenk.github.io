          This is a post from our old site. Original post is archived <a href="https://archive.is/xwMD3">here</a>.

        <p>In this post, you will be explained how to identify hoaxes, how to be safe and their potential hazards.</p>

<p>What is a hoax? A hoax is a false message(s) or attachment(s) circulated on social media (even via Emails) for,</p>
<ul>
<li> Enjoyment </li>
<li>Marketing </li>
<li>Social Studies </li>
<li>Canvassing</li>
<li>Hacking & Phishing</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of these motives are harmless but the potential hazards are greater. I will show some examples of hoaxes below. [Fictional Examples]</p>

<p>While most of them seem harmless and fun, they will have a lasting impact on you or on your device. The content is not to be taken seriously and the links and attachments can include malware.</p>

<p>While some ignore these, some people take them to be real and share the hoax afraid of the content, or by believing it's content. If you believe that you specifically have been mentioned in hoax messages, contact law enforcement authorities immediately.</p>
