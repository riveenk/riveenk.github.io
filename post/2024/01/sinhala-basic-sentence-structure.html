        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Hello again, and Happy New Year!&nbsp;සුභ අලුත් අවුරුද්දක් වේවා! Today we will
            look into understanding Sinhala sentence structure. Technically speaking, most
            of the time, word order in a sentence wouldn't make any difference to the
            meaning and is grammartically correct (personally, I never use a specific word
            order). However, it would be best practice to have a general structure in mind
            when you're first learning the language. That where today's post come in. If
            you haven't looked into the Sinhala Script before, I recommend you do it
            <a href="/post/2023/08/sinhala-letters-intro.html">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            We begin with <b>statements</b>. <i>For example: I went home. </i>This
            structure is applicable for both present and non-present tenses (we will cover
            it next lesson).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><ul><li>Present tense:&nbsp;මම ගෙදර යනවා. (I am going home)<span style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="text-align: left;">Non-present tense (past):&nbsp;මම ගෙදර ගියා. (I went home)</span></li></ul><p></p>
          <p>
            With statements, I recommend you use a structure of [subject] + [object] +
            [verb]. However, this isn't to say that a different order would've made much
            of a difference. But things get a bit tricky when you have multiple entities
            in the subject along with adverbs and adjectives. See the following examples:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="text-align: justify;">Present tense:&nbsp;ඔයායි මමයි ලොකු ගෙදරට හෙමිහිට දුවනවා. (You and I are
              slowly running to the big house.)</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li>Non-present tense (past):&nbsp;ඔයායි මමයි ලොකු ගෙදරට හෙමිහිට දිව්වා. (<span style="text-align: justify;">You and I slowly ran to the big house.</span>)</li></ul><p></p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Here, note that&nbsp;<span style="text-align: justify;">ඔයායි මමයි are two entities (you and I); but similar to English, they are
              collectively considered as one subject. So, you can't separate them within a
              sentence, in order to be grammatically correct. Next, look at&nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left;">ලොකු ගෙදරට.&nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left;">ලොකු means big, and is the adjective, while&nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left;">ගෙදර[ට] means [to the] house and is the object. Again, similar to English,
              the adjective is considered as part of the object and cannot be split within
              a sentence. However, now that we reach&nbsp;</span>හෙමිහිට දුවනවා, things change. හෙමිහිට means slowly and දුවනවා means
            [is/am/are] running. But the thing is, unlike the others, it wouldn't be wrong
            for you to split the two within the sentence.
          </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Moving on to <b>questions</b>, we can see that the change is not a drastic one. Looking at the following example, we can see that the only difference is that there is a question particle added to the end.&nbsp;</p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Present tense:&nbsp;මම ගෙදර යනවාද? (Am I going home?)<span style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="text-align: left;">Non-present tense (past):&nbsp;මම ගෙදර ගියාද?&nbsp;(Did I go home?)</span></li></ul><div>See? It isn't that much of an addition. The same rules apply. It's completely fine if it takes you time, it took me a few days to process this when I first learnt it too.</div>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            So, as a starting point, I'd reccommend you to stick with a sentence structure
            because that would help you to develop your vocabulary and other grammar first
            and then work on the nuances of the language.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            [adjective(s) + subject(s)] + [adjective(s) + object(s)] + [adverb(s) +
            adjective(s)] + (question part.)</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <b>Important!!!</b>&nbsp;Although you begin with a template sentence
            structure, I encourage you to try and move things around and understand the
            dynamics of the langauge. Trust me, it is a beautiful language, but every
            beautiful art once had some (relatively) hideous sketch lines. Until next
            time!<br /><br />
