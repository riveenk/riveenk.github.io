        <h2 class="body-header">How to make a Debating Motion?</h2>
        <h4 class="body-subheader">20 May, 2024</h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Today we will be talking about motions. I would be using debating terms like “motion” here and there, but I will always include a link of that word to my <a href="/page/debating-glossary.html">debating terminology glossary.</a>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Let’s get started. So, what is a <a href="/page/debating-glossary.html#motion">motion</a>? Basically, it is the topic which the debate is about. There are two sides which would be arguing this (although there could be four teams, sometimes). Without further ado, point number one:
        </p>

        <h3>1. Balance is Key</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            The first thing I would suggest you consider is whether there is a balanced argument to both sides. Can both sides make a case, can either side win? This is where the real skill of creating a motion comes into play. You shouldn’t make a motion where there is a defined answer to, for example, a motion like “<a href="/page/debating-glossary.html#THBT">THBT</a> crime should not be punished”. These are questions which have a recognised answer to.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that motions cannot be controversial (personally, I prefer the controversial ones). You could well have something like “<a href="/page/debating-glossary.html#THW">THW</a> make the age of consent universal” or even “<a href="/page/debating-glossary.html#THW">THW</a> kill baby Hitler”, because why not? Then there is also the idea of a motion that either side can win.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            I’ve never seen a motion like this before, because it is very difficult to make a debatable motion with an obvious winner. So, my best attempt here would be, for example, “<a href="/page/debating-glossary.html#THBT">THBT</a> the Earth is flat”. Because the answer is obvious, the Earth is round (if you are a flat-earther, please exit my website).        
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            So, in simple terms, make sure both sides can argue it. 
        </p>

        <h3>2. Make it “debate-worthy”</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            This section is really a self-insert. As someone who makes motions on the fly, quite regularly, I have curated myself a filter to ensure the debate is something worth debating (it is definitely not because I need to judge that). Because debating is not a chore, and it shouldn’t be. Looking at real-world examples, people passionately argue about things that matter, not about how the rock on the side of the pavement shouldn’t have moss on it. 
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            This is where my preference for controversial motions slip in. Controversial things are always bound to spark more engagement and a better debate for all of us to enjoy and learn from. When making motions, try to be aware of current events. These will help you stay up to date on what is trending and what is not.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            To be succinct, don’t make them argue about whether the moon is yellow or not (and definitely not that workplace argument you had last week about coffee). 
        </p>

        <h3>3.  Have a heart</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            This is something I always have to remind myself of. Debaters are people too. Not only do they have feelings, they also have limitations. What I am getting here is don’t give a “THBT the fiscal policies of the IMF were catastrophic for Sub Saharan economies” motion to a bunch of Year Seven students. 
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Giving uncomfortable motions is key for debaters to be able to argue regardless of what motion they get (it’s not like they can say no). However, one must remember that this exposure must be controlled to stop debating from becoming one of those dreadful after-school practice sessions. Debating is more than just about arguing, that is why weirdos like you and me are interested in this. 
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            In summary, if you are ever in doubt about whether a motion is good, take a sheet of paper, draw a line in the middle, and write down at least 3 constructives for both sides (without Googling anything). If you can, there you go, you have made yourself a motion. If you don’t feel like making a motion, Hello Motions has a nice list. Happy debating!
