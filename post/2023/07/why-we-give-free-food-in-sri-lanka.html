            This is a post from our old site. Original post is archived <a href="https://archive.is/LCBzQ">here</a>.

        <p>For my fellow foodies out there, I know this is a very tempting situation to be in. However, this isn't only fun, but also religious. The previous two months, May and June, are referred as Vesak and Poson months respectively in the local calendar names. The full moon days of these months (and of every other month) are referred as 'Poya Days'. Apart from being monthly holidays, according to Buddhist and Sinhala cultures, these days signify dates of religious and auspicious importance.</p>

<p>Vesak and Poson Poya days are, in a sense, the most famous ones of them all. These two days commemorate the Birth of Prince Siddhartha (Lord Buddha prior to enlightenment), The Enlightenment and The Passing away (Parinirvana) of Lord Buddha; and the introduction of Buddhism to Sri Lanka by Arahath Mihindu Thero, respectively. So, these are pretty important days. </p>

<p>Without keeping you much longer, let's talk about what you're here for. The food. So, yes, free food is given during the Vesak and Poson 'seasons' by charitable people. These are called "Dansal" [dun-sul or dun-səl] which in a literal translation would mean something along the lines of "Offering Hall". The more common dansals are Ice Cream, Rice, and Drinks (non-alcoholic, of course).</p>

<p>The experience of going to dansal are a very different one. At those times, friends and families would get into groups and would cover large areas for dansals. We call it "dansal vandinawa" [dan-sul vaňdinavā]. There would be long (like really long) queues for the dansals and you would probably burn more calories standing than you would get from getting the food (talk about fun diets, haha). If you're lucky, someone you know would be in the queue and get you in, else, off you go to the end of the line.</p>

<p>The luxury of having a 'dansal-rice' is unparalleled. The meal is simple, completely vegetarian. The usual would be, rice, pol sambola (grated coconut inside mixed with chilli, lime juice and onion pieces), dhal/lentil curry and tempered onions. The mood is made complete with religious songs going in the background. Ahh, the nostalgia.</p>

<p>I could never do enough justice in explaining how this is by a blog post. So, if you ever happen to be in Sri Lanka during these seasons, do join the line (and if you look identifiably foreign, you might as well get a free upgrade to the front of the line and extra servings).</p>

<p>I will share separate posts on Sri Lanka cuisine and Buddhist culture soon. Until then, have a nice time!</p>
