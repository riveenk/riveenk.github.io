            This is a post from our old site. Original post is archived <a href="https://archive.ph/bEmPm">here</a>.

        <p>
            Have you ever stalked someone? I know you have, hopefully on the internet, because that is what I'm writing about today (not stalking).
          </p>
          <p>
            In today's world, your digital footprint can reveal a lot about you. And depending on what and how much you share, anyone from stalkers to employers and schools can find out a lot about you. Considering the risks involved, we all need proper protection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember your best friend's crush that you 'researched'? The same can happen to you. And after you saw some selfies that guy took with a girl who was 'too close' to him, you had to break the news to your best friends: "They're taken." A similar impact can happen to you too. Having a clean digital footprint can not only create an awesome personal brand, which is useful in personal, academic, and professional lives, but also protect you from potential data breaches.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's take an example: our usual guy, John Smith. He posts this on Instagram:
          </p>
          
          <div class="instagram-post">
            <div class="profile-info">
              <img alt="Profile Picture" class="profile-pic" src="/media/are-you-being-stalked-2.png" />
              <p class="poster-name">John Smith <span style="color: #80b6ff;">Follow</span></p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-block">
              <img alt="Image 1" src="/media/are-you-being-stalked-1.png" style="width: 100%;" />          
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <p style="color: #eeeeee; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;">
              <span style="color: white; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><b> John Smith </b></span>B'day treat for ml <span style="color: white;">@banana_07 </span> at #theReallyExpensivePlace
            </p>
          </div></div>
          
          <p>
            Now, from this, a stalker can learn about this @banana_07 girl, her birthday, and John's finances. An employer or a school administrator would see that Johnny is a heavy drinker, and that does not look good on him.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is just an example. But such a post is enough for an employer to decide that John is not the best guy for the job. It is enough for a "stalker" to either choose him for a scam, rob his house, or get ideas to crack his password.
          </p>
          <p>
            How can you maintain a social media life AND have a clean digital footprint?
          </p>
          
          <ol style="text-align: left;">
            <li>
              Adjust privacy settings: For example, use the Private Mode on Instagram.
            </li>
            <li>
              Consider delayed posting: Delay posting about holidays, outings, and birthdays so that no one can pinpoint your exact location and activities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Maintain a Smart-Casual image: On your public platforms, present yourself in a work- or school-friendly manner.
            </li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>
            With these steps, you can prevent oversharing, protect your privacy and that of others, and avoid the troubles John got into. You can also present a smarter image on social media.
          </p>
          <p>Until next time, stay safe online!</p>
