                JWSDC Format is used in the JWSDC (duh) and involves two teams of three members. The Proposition argues
                for the motion, and the Opposition argues against the motion. There will be three constructive speeches
                and two reply speeches.

                <h3>Leader of Proposition</h3>
                <p>The Leader of Proposition introduces the motion, defines the key terms, and characterises the context
                    of the debate. Sometimes, the Leader of Proposition would introduce a module if it is a practical or
                    actor motion. They are expected to present the greater portion of the proposition case, often at
                    least two constructives. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <h3>Leader of Opposition</h3>
                <p>The Leader of Opposition defines any further key terms (if need be), challenges Proposition
                    definitions (if need be), and characterises their context for the debate. The Leader of Opposition
                    may choose to introduce a counter-module if it is a practical or actor motion. They are also
                    expected to present the greater portion of the opposition case. They are not expected to rebut the
                    proposition case. </p>

            <div class="box">
                <h3>Deputy Leader of Proposition</h3>
                <p>The Deputy Leader of Proposition supports the case presented by the Leader of Opposition, extends any
                    left out parts, and presents new constructives. They are not expected to present more than one
                    constructive. However, the Deputy Leader of Proposition is expected to present rebuttals against the
                    Opposition case. They are often advised to maintain a balance between the amount of constructives
                    and rebuttals in their speeches.</p>

                    left out parts, and presents new constructives. They are also not expected to present more than one
                    constructive but expected to present rebuttals against the Proposition case. They are also advised
                    to maintain a balance between the amount of constructives and rebuttals in their speeches.</p>

                <h3>Proposition Whip</h3>
                <p>The Proposition Whip carries the main responsibility of analysing common themes and clashpoints
                    within the whole debate. They are expected to share how the Proposition case is more justifes and
                    stands victorious over the Opposition case. They are also not expected to rebut, but may find it
                    useful as part of their clashpoint analysis. The Whip is not allowed to produce new constructives.
                    However, it is possible to shed clarity over and further substantiate existing constructives.</p>

                <h3>Opposition Whip</h3>
                <p>The Opposition Whip also carries the main responsibility of analysing common themes and clashpoints
                    within the whole debate. They are expected to share how the Opposition case is more justifes and
                    stands victorious over the Proposition case. They are also not expected to rebut, but may find it

                <h3>Proposition & Opposition Replies</h3>
                <p>Reply speeches do not affect the overall case and reply speakers are not allowed to produce new
                    constructives or rebuttals. This is often compared to a "biased adjudication" due to its relfective
                    role in summarising each case and finalising the debate. Only the first or second speaker of each
                    team are allowed to take this role. </p>
