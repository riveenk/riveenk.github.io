                <div class="debating-intro">
                    OxSD Format is a public debating model that involves two teams of several members (typically
                    three). The Proposition argues for the motion, and the Opposition argues against the motion. There are multiple sections to
                    this format and it is adapted in various ways by various organisers. A debate/ tournament may opt to alter the nature or composition of the following list. Traditional sections are marked with an asterisk (*).

                <div class="timings">
                    <p>Speeches are often prepared in advance</p>
                    <p>Opening Remarks: Often 07:00 to 10:00 Minutes</p>
                    <p>Floor Speech: About 01:00 Minutes</p>
                    <p>Closing Remarks: No Specified Limit (Contextual)</p>

                <h3 class="teach-title">Roles Present in the Room</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li class="teach-list">
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Chairperson</span>: A chairperson presides over the debate and moderates audience participation. Always be respectful to the chairperson and it is common courtesy to refer to them as "Honourable Chairperson".
                    </li>
                    <li class="teach-list">
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Debaters</span>: This is you (hopefully). Your job is to debate for the motion you have prepared for and give it your best job. Remember, a debate is just a debate. Doing your best is more than enough. A win is just a bonus.
                    </li>
                    <li class="teach-list">
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Observers</span>: Observers are non-participating members in a debate. They may choose to speak for a small period during the Floor Speeches. However, their greatest duty is to vote at the end of the debate to choose a winner.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="teach-title">Debate Structure and Explanation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li class="teach-list">
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Opening Vote</span>: 
                        Some modern adaptations will feature an initial vote to see the audience's opinion before the debate has begun. This will be used to measure the greatest gain in popularity by the end of the debate.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li class="teach-list">
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Opening Remarks*</span>: 
                        This section features alternating speeches between the two teams where they produce their case whilst rebutting the other side. There is no clear cut structure to these speeches, and rhetoric wit and oratory skills tend to resonate better with the audience. The first speakers of each side will also introduce the speakers of the other team as well. Opening remarks should balance advocacy for your own case with critique of the opponent.
                    </li>

                    <li class="teach-list">
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Floor Speeches*</span>: 
                        At this stage, the Chairperson may invite several members of the audience presenting their opinion and/or arguments in a limited amount of time (around a minute). These speeches may be curated to produce a range of opinions. These speeches are non-competitive and are used to encourage audience engagement.
                    </li>

                    <li class="teach-list">
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Panel Discussion</span>: 
                        Some modern adaptations may allow speakers to directly engage with each other. This may be used as a podium to clarify your case as well as attack specific aspects of the other case. Some organisers may opt to moderate this in form of a talk-show. This is a grand opportunity for teams to engage thoroughly with their opponents.
                    </li>

                    <li class="teach-list">
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Questions and Answer Session</span>: 
                        Many adaptations opt for a QnA Session in addition to the POIs raised by the audience. This would allow the audience to raise questions that have emerged throughout the debate. These questions may be targeted as pleased and seek to clarify or challenge. This would be the final opportunity for the audience to engage with the debaters.
                    </li>

                    <li class="teach-list">
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Closing Vote*</span>: 
                        This is the final stage where the audience members will vote on which team to win. Traditional versions may involve members physically walking through the "Aye" and "Noe" doors. However, modern adaptations would use raised hands or digital voting.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="teach-title">How to Win</h3>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Government vs. Opposition</span>: Teams will be judged based on how persuasive they are. It is often not encouraged to be highly technical as they will be judged by a general audience. This also means that the oratory skills of the debaters play a larger role in their performance. Often presentation takes more weighting than pure theory. It would be beneficial for members to practice on their public speaking skills and technical speaking skills. Speeches may employ personal attacks (within reason) as a debate tactic to undermine opposing speakers, as well as humour and sarcasm. Remember that these are often only tactic and that you can use them within reason too (although personally, don't use attacks).</p>
                <h3 class="teach-title">Adjudication Outcome</h3>
                <p>The audience holds the sole adjudication power and the winner is chosen by popular vote. The exact process may vary by debate. However, we can often generalise it as follows: Majority vote wins in a debate with only a closing vote. Greatest voter gain wins in a debate with both an opening and closing debate.</p>
