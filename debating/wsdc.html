                    WSDC Format is used in the WSDC (duh) and involves two teams of three members. The Proposition
                    argues for the motion, and the Opposition argues against the motion. There will be three
                    constructive speeches and two reply speeches.

                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prime Minister (PM)</span>: The Prime
                        Minister introduces the
                        motion, defines the key terms, and characterises the context of the debate. Sometimes, the Prime
                        Minister would introduce a module if it is a practical or actor motion. They are expected to
                        present
                        the greater portion of the Proposition case, often at least two constructives. Their definitions
                        hold
                        for the Closing Bench as well. </li>
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Leader of Opposition</span>: The Leader of
                        Opposition defines any further key terms (if need
                        be), challenges Proposition definitions (if need be), and characterises their context for the
                        debate. The Leader of Opposition may choose to introduce a counter-module if it is a practical
                        or actor motion. They are also expected to present the greater portion of the opposition case.
                        They are not expected to rebut the Proposition case.</li>
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Deputy Prime Minister (DPM)</span>: The
                        Deputy Prime Minister
                        supports the case presented by the Prime Minister, extends any left out parts, and presents new
                        constructives. They are not expected to present more than one constructive. However, the Deputy
                        Prime Minister is expected to present rebuttals against the Opposition case. They are often
                        advised
                        to maintain a balance between the amount of constructives and rebuttals in their speeches.</li>
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Deputy Leader of Opposition (DLO)</span>:
                        The Deputy Leader of
                        Opposition supports the case presented by the Leader of Opposition extends any left out parts,
                        and
                        presents new constructives. They are also not expected to present more than one constructive but
                        expected to present rebuttals against the Proposition case. They are also advised to maintain a
                        balance between the amount of constructives and rebuttals in their speeches.</li>

                        expected
                        to share how the Proposition case is more justifed and stands victorious over the Opposition
                        case.
                        They are also not expected to rebut, but may find it useful as part of their clashpoint
                        analysis.
                        The Whip is not allowed to produce new constructives. However, it is possible to shed clarity
                        over
                        and further substantiate existing constructives. They must defend and analyse the cases of both
                        the
                        opening and closing benches. </li>
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Opposition Whip (OW)</span>: The Opposition
                        Whip also carries the
                        main responsibility of analysing common themes and clashpoints within the whole debate. They are
                        expected to share how the Opposition case is more justifed and stands victorious over the
                        Proposition
                        case. They are also not expected to rebut, but may find it useful as part of their clashpoint
                        analysis. The Whip is not allowed to produce new constructives. However, it is possible to shed
                        clarity over and further substantiate existing constructives. They must defend and analyse the
                        cases
                        of both the opening and closing benches. </li>

                    case would be favoured. Teams must attack their opposing team and produce a case that can
                    withstand the rebuttals.</p>
