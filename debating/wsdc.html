                WSDC Format is used in the WSDC (duh) and involves two teams of three members. The Proposition argues for the motion, and the Opposition argues against the motion. There will be three constructive speeches and two reply speeches.

                <h3>Leader of Proposition</h3>
                <p>The Leader of Proposition introduces the motion, defines the key terms, and characterises the context of the debate. Sometimes, the Leader of Proposition would introduce a module if it is a practical or actor motion. They are expected to present the greater portion of the proposition case, often at least two constructives. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <h3>Leader of Opposition</h3>
                <p>The Leader of Opposition defines any further key terms (if need be), challenges Proposition definitions (if need be), and characterises their context for the debate. The Leader of Opposition may choose to introduce a counter-module if it is a practical or actor motion. They are also expected to present the greater portion of the opposition case. They are not expected to rebut the proposition case. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <h3>Deputy Leader of Proposition</h3>
                <p>The Deputy Leader of Proposition supports the case presented by the Leader of Proposition, extends any left out parts, and presents new constructives. They are not expected to present more than one constructive. However, the Deputy Leader of Proposition is expected to present rebuttals against the Opposition case. They are often advised to maintain a balance between the amount of constructives and rebuttals in their speeches.</p>

            <div class="box">
                <h3>Deputy Leader of Opposition</h3>
                <p>The Deputy Leader of Opposition supports the case presented by the Leader of Opposition, extends any left out parts, and presents new constructives. They are also not expected to present more than one constructive but expected to present rebuttals against the Proposition case. They are also advised to maintain a balance between the amount of constructives and rebuttals in their speeches.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <h3>Proposition Whip</h3>
                <p>The Proposition Whip carries the main responsibility of analysing common themes and clashpoints within the whole debate. They are expected to share how the Proposition case is more justifed and stands victorious over the Opposition case. They are also not expected to rebut, but may find it useful as part of their clashpoint analysis. The Whip is not allowed to produce new constructives. However, it is possible to shed clarity over and further substantiate existing constructives.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <h3>Opposition Whip</h3>
                <p>The Opposition Whip also carries the main responsibility of analysing common themes and clashpoints within the whole debate. They are expected to share how the Opposition case is more justifed and stands victorious over the Proposition case. They are also not expected to rebut, but may find it useful as part of their clashpoint analysis. The Whip is not allowed to produce new constructives. However, it is possible to shed clarity over and further substantiate existing constructives.</p>

            <div class="box">
                <h3>Proposition & Opposition Replies</h3>
                <p>Reply speeches do not affect the overall case and reply speakers are not allowed to produce new constructives or rebuttals. This is often compared to a "biased adjudication" due to its relfective role in summarising each case and finalising the debate. Only the first or second speaker of each team are allowed to take this role. </p>
