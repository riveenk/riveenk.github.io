                    WSDC Format is used in the World Schools Debating Championship and involves two teams of three members. The Proposition
                    argues for the motion, and the Opposition argues against the motion. There are three
                    constructive
                    speeches and a reply speech for each team.

                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Adjudicator [a-juudikater]</span>: An adjudicator moderates and evaluates the debate to produce feedback and a winner at the end. Always be respectful to the adjudicator and it is common courtesy to refer to them as "Honourable Adjudicator" or "Honourable Chair" (when there is only one adjudicator).
                    </li>
                    <li class="teach-list">
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Timer</span>: The timer is responsible for displaying the speech length of each debater. They may use a bell or an alarm system to indicate the first minute, last minute, and the end. You may request for a stopwatch or a timer based on your preference.
                    </li>

                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Organising Committee Member</span>: Some tournaments may assign members from the OC to observe and assist rooms during a debate. This may involve a dedicated member or a roaming member/s.

                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Observers</span>: Observers are non-participating members in a debate. They are typically present only in final rounds or online rounds. However, some in-person tournaments may allow a limited number of observers in preliminary rounds as well. It is important that observers maintain good behaviour and not disrupt the debate or provide any support to the debaters.

                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Proposition First Speaker (Prop 1)</span>: The Prime
                        Minister introduces the
                        motion, defines the key terms, and characterises the context of the debate. Sometimes, the Prime
                        Minister would introduce a module if it is a practical or actor motion. They are expected to
                        present
                        the greater portion of the government case, often at least two constructives. Their definitions
                        hold
                        for the Closing Benches as well. </li>
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Opposition First Speaker (Opp 1)</span>: The Leader of
                        Opposition defines any further key terms (if need
                        be), challenges government definitions (if need be), and characterises their context for the
                        debate. The Leader of Opposition may choose to introduce a counter-module if it is a practical
                        or actor motion. They are also expected to present the greater portion of the opposition case.
                        However, they are not expected to rebut the government case.</li>
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Proposition Second Speaker (Prop 2)</span>: The
                        Deputy Prime Minister
                        supports the case presented by the Prime Minister, extends any left out parts, and presents new
                        constructives. They are not expected to present more than one constructive. However, the Deputy
                        Prime Minister is expected to present rebuttals against the Opposition case. They are often
                        advised
                        to maintain a balance between the amount of constructives and rebuttals in their speeches.</li>
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Opposition Second Speaker (Opp 2)</span>:
                        The Deputy Leader of
                        Opposition supports the case presented by the Leader of Opposition extends any left out parts,
                        and
                        presents new constructives. They are also not expected to present more than one constructive but
                        expected to present rebuttals against the government case. They are also advised to maintain a
                        balance between the amount of constructives and rebuttals in their speeches.</li>
                    
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Proposition Third Speaker (Prop 3)</span>: The Government
                        Whip carries the main
                        responsibility of analysing common themes and clash-points within the whole debate. They are
                        expected
                        to share how the government case is more justified and stands victorious over the Opposition
                        case.
                        They are also not expected to rebut, but may find it useful as part of their clash-point
                        analysis.
                        The Whip is not allowed to produce new constructives. However, it is possible to shed clarity
                        over
                        and further substantiate existing constructives. They must defend and analyse the cases of both
                        the
                        opening and closing benches. </li>
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Opposition Third Speaker (Opp 3)</span>: The Opposition

                        expected to share how the Opposition case is more justified and stands victorious over the

                <h3 class="teach-title">How to Win</h3>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Government vs. Opposition</span>: Teams will be judged based on the quality of their arguments, completeness of their presentation, resilience against the other team, and quality of rebuttals. Individual contributions will also be factored in when assessing a team's overall score. There must be clear balance between constructives and rebuttals ensuring that the case is both defensive and offensive.</p>
                <h3 class="teach-title">Adjudication Outcome</h3>
                <p>The winner team is selected and revealed. Some tournaments also recognise a best speaker for every debate. Many adjudicators will provide an extended description and explanation for their decision (known as an Oral Adjudication or OA).</p>
