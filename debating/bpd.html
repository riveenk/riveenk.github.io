                    BPD Format is a parliamentary debating model that involves four teams of two members. The Government
                    argues for the motion, and the Opposition argues against the motion. The two sides are futher
                    divided into the Opening and Closing Benches, each with separate expectations on them. There will be
                    eight constructive speeches and no reply speeches.

                <ol>
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prime Minister (PM)</span>: The Prime
                        Minister introduces the
                        motion, defines the key terms, and characterises the context of the debate. Sometimes, the Prime
                        Minister would introduce a module if it is a practical or actor motion. They are expected to
                        present
                        the greater portion of the government case, often at least two constructives. Their definitions
                        hold
                        for the Closing Bench as well. </li>
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Leader of Opposition</span>: The Leader of
                        Opposition defines any further key terms (if need
                        be), challenges government definitions (if need be), and characterises their context for the
                        debate. The Leader of Opposition may choose to introduce a counter-module if it is a practical
                        or actor motion. They are also expected to present the greater portion of the opposition case.
                        They are not expected to rebut the government case.</li>
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Deputy Prime Minister (DPM)</span>: The
                        Deputy Prime Minister
                        supports the case presented by the Prime Minister, extends any left out parts, and presents new
                        constructives. They are not expected to present more than one constructive. However, the Deputy
                        Prime Minister is expected to present rebuttals against the Opposition case. They are often
                        advised
                        to maintain a balance between the amount of constructives and rebuttals in their speeches.</li>
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Deputy Leader of Opposition (DLO)</span>:
                        The Deputy Leader of
                        Opposition supports the case presented by the Leader of Opposition extends any left out parts,
                        and
                        presents new constructives. They are also not expected to present more than one constructive but
                        expected to present rebuttals against the government case. They are also advised to maintain a
                        balance between the amount of constructives and rebuttals in their speeches.</li>
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Member of Government (MG)</span>: The Member
                        of Government holds
                        the responsibility to build the proposition case of the Closing Bench. They will not be awarded
                        for
                        reusing arguments from the opening bench. They too are advised to maintain a balance between the
                        amount of constructives and rebuttals in their speeches. However, it is ideal for them to spend
                        time
                        highlighting their case over the opening bench's. They must maintain the case of the opening
                        bench
                        and never contradict them. That would only penalise themselves. </li>

                        of Opposition holds

                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Government Whip (GW)</span>: The Government
                        Whip carries the main
                        responsibility of analysing common themes and clashpoints within the whole debate. They are
                        expected
                        to share how the government case is more justifed and stands victorious over the Opposition
                        case.
                        They are also not expected to rebut, but may find it useful as part of their clashpoint
                        analysis.
                        The Whip is not allowed to produce new constructives. However, it is possible to shed clarity
                        over
                        and further substantiate existing constructives. They must defend and analyse the cases of both
                        the
                        opening and closing benches. </li>

                <h3 class="teach-title">How to Win</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Government vs. Opposition</span>: The side
                        that presents the best
                        case would be favoured. Opening benches must attack their opposing bench and produce a case that
                        can
                        withstand the rebuttals from the Closing bench as well.</li>
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Opening Bench</span>: If a Opening bench
                        produces a case that is
                        more resilient to both cases against theirs and is more prominent than the Closing bench, they
                        would
                        be favoured. It is always beneficial to invest in building a strong and heavy case if you are an
                        Opening bench.</li>
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Closing Bench</span>: If a closing bench
                        produces a case that does
                        not contradicting of their Opening bench but builds up more prominently than their Opening
                        bench. It
                        is always beneficial to invest in building a larger case to ensure that you would not repeat the
                        Opening bench. Create a ranked case of constructives, and focus on attacking the other case.
                    </li>
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Knifing</span>: This is when the Closing
                        bench contradicts or even attacks their Opening counterpart. Do *not* do this as many, if not
                        all, tournaments will penalise that and even result in the knifing team being ranked fourth.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="teach-title">Adjudication Outcome</h3>
