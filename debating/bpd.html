                    BPD Format is a parliamentary debating model that involves four teams of two members. The Government
                    argues for the motion, and the Opposition argues against the motion. The two sides are futher
                    divided into the Opening and Closing Benches, each with separate expectations on them. There are
                    two constructive speeches for each team and no reply speeches.

                <ul>
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prime Minister (PM)</span>: The Prime
                        Minister introduces the
                        motion, defines the key terms, and characterises the context of the debate. Sometimes, the Prime
                        Minister would introduce a module if it is a practical or actor motion. They are expected to
                        present
                        the greater portion of the government case, often at least two constructives. Their definitions
                        hold
                        for the Closing Benches as well. </li>
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Leader of Opposition (LO)</span>: The Leader of
                        Opposition defines any further key terms (if need
                        be), challenges government definitions (if need be), and characterises their context for the
                        debate. The Leader of Opposition may choose to introduce a counter-module if it is a practical
                        or actor motion. They are also expected to present the greater portion of the opposition case.
                        However, they are not expected to rebut the government case.</li>
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Deputy Prime Minister (DPM)</span>: The
                        Deputy Prime Minister
                        supports the case presented by the Prime Minister, extends any left out parts, and presents new
                        constructives. They are not expected to present more than one constructive. However, the Deputy
                        Prime Minister is expected to present rebuttals against the Opposition case. They are often
                        advised
                        to maintain a balance between the amount of constructives and rebuttals in their speeches.</li>
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Deputy Leader of Opposition (DLO)</span>:
                        The Deputy Leader of
                        Opposition supports the case presented by the Leader of Opposition extends any left out parts,
                        and
                        presents new constructives. They are also not expected to present more than one constructive but
                        expected to present rebuttals against the government case. They are also advised to maintain a
                        balance between the amount of constructives and rebuttals in their speeches.</li>
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Member of Government (MG)</span>: The Member
                        of Government holds
                        the responsibility to build the proposition case of the Closing Bench. They will not be awarded
                        for
                        reusing arguments from the opening bench. They too are advised to maintain a balance between the
                        amount of constructives and rebuttals in their speeches. However, it is ideal for them to spend
                        time
                        highlighting their case over the opening bench's. They must still maintain the case of the opening
                        bench
                        and never contradict them. That would only penalise themselves. </li>
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Member of Opposition (MO)</span>: The Member
                        of Opposition holds
                        the responsibility to build the opposition case of the Closing Bench. They will not be awarded

                        bench
                        and never contradict them. That would only penalise themselves. </li>
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Government Whip (GW)</span>: The Government
                        Whip carries the main
                        responsibility of analysing common themes and clashpoints within the whole debate. They are
                        expected
                        to share how the government case is more justifed and stands victorious over the Opposition
                        case.
                        They are also not expected to rebut, but may find it useful as part of their clashpoint
                        analysis.
                        The Whip is not allowed to produce new constructives. However, it is possible to shed clarity
                        over
                        and further substantiate existing constructives. They must defend and analyse the cases of both
                        the
                        opening and closing benches. </li>
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Opposition Whip (OW)</span>: The Opposition
                        Whip also carries the
                        main responsibility of analysing common themes and clashpoints within the whole debate. They are
                        expected to share how the Opposition case is more justifed and stands victorious over the
                        government
                        case. They are also not expected to rebut, but may find it useful as part of their clashpoint
                        analysis. The Whip is not allowed to produce new constructives. However, it is possible to shed
                        clarity over and further substantiate existing constructives. They must defend and analyse the
                        cases
                        of both the opening and closing benches. </li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="teach-title">How to Win</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Government vs. Opposition</span>: Teams will be judged based on the quality of their arguments, completeness of their presentation, resilience against the other team, and quality of rebuttals. Individual contributions will also be factored in when assessing a team's overall score. There must be clear balance between constructives and rebuttals ensuring that the case is both defensive and offensive.</li>

                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Opening Bench</span>: An opening bench case should retain the basis of the case of their closing counterpart. It should also play a definitive role in ensuring the closing case is an extension of the opening case. The best method of asserting this power is to cover major and stable constructives to restrict the closing bench into only strengthening your case.</li>

                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Closing Bench</span>: A closing bench case should produce a case that is not dependent on their opening counterpart. However, it may be beneficial to contribute if the opening case has any significant faults, without becoming an extension of it. The best method of producing a great closing case is to focus on creating an extended case (in case the opening bench mentions them) whilst ensuring that the case is not entirely major constructives. It is beneficial to think out of the box, and produce a strong clashpoint analysis as well. 
                    </li>

                    <li class="teach-list"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Knifing</span>: This is the process of a closing bench contradicting or attacking their opening counterpart. Do not do this. Some tournaments or even judges may penalise teams for it, even to the extent of an automatic fourth rank. Closing benches must pay close attention to their opening counterparts and ensure that the cases do not contradict each other. Closing benches must also be careful in discussing their opening bench within their speech as rebuttals also count as knifing.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="teach-title">Adjudication Outcome</h3>
                <p>The teams will be ordered into a ranked list. First rank is for the best team and so on until the fourth. Most common rankings would have a clear side that is ranked on the top, and therefore the larger goal is to be the more successful bench in a side. Many adjudicators will provide an extended description and explaination for their decision (known as an Oral Adjudication or OA).</p>
