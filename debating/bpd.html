            <div class="debating-intro">
                BPD Format is a parliamentary debating model that involves four teams of two members. The Government argues for the motion, and the Opposition argues against the motion. The two sides are futher divided into the Opening and Closing Benches, each with separate expectations on them. There will be eight constructive speeches and no reply speeches.

                <h3>Prime Minister</h3>
                <p>The Prime Minister introduces the motion, defines the key terms, and characterises the context of the debate. Sometimes, the Prime Minister would introduce a module if it is a practical or actor motion. They are expected to present the greater portion of the government case, often at least two constructives. Their definitions hold for the Closing Bench as well. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <h3>Leader of Opposition</h3>
                <p>The Leader of Opposition defines any further key terms (if need be), challenges government definitions (if need be), and characterises their context for the debate. The Leader of Opposition may choose to introduce a counter-module if it is a practical or actor motion. They are also expected to present the greater portion of the opposition case. They are not expected to rebut the government case. </p>

                <h3>Deputy Prime Minister</h3>
                <p>The Deputy Prime Minister supports the case presented by the Prime Minister, extends any left out parts, and presents new constructives. They are not expected to present more than one constructive. However, the Deputy Prime Minister is expected to present rebuttals against the Opposition case. They are often advised to maintain a balance between the amount of constructives and rebuttals in their speeches.</p>

They are also not expected to present more than one constructive but expected to present rebuttals against the government case.

                <h3>Member of Government</h3>
                <p>The Member of Government holds the responsibility to build the proposition case of the Closing Bench. They will not be awarded for reusing arguments from the opening bench. They too are advised to maintain a balance between the amount of constructives and rebuttals in their speeches. However, it is ideal for them to spend time highlighting their case over the opening bench's. They must maintain the case of the opening bench and never contradict them. That would only penalise themselves. </p>

                <h3>Government Whip</h3>
                <p>The Government Whip carries the main responsibility of analysing common themes and clashpoints within the whole debate. They are expected to share how the government case is more justifed and stands victorious over the Opposition case. They are also not expected to rebut, but may find it useful as part of their clashpoint analysis. The Whip is not allowed to produce new constructives. However, it is possible to shed clarity over and further substantiate existing constructives. They must defend and analyse the cases of both the opening and closing benches. </p>
