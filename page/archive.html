                            <h3>50 Shades of Gender: Gender Complexity and Post-Gender Society</h3>
                            <p>For much of recorded history, gender and sex were used interchangeably: male meant XY
                                chromosomes and
                                masculinity, female meant XX chromosomes and femininity. However, modern gender has
                                evolved into a
                                broader and more nuanced spectrum—some sources listing dozens—if not hundreds—of
                                uniquely defined
                                identities. This essay examines the nature of gender, and argues for abolishing gender
                                as a descriptive
                                identifying term.
                                Historically, and even now in some societies, gender was a binary. I, myself, have seen
                                and experienced
                                what it feels like to be a part of such a society. Modern definition of “gender” has
                                evolved away from
                                “sex” into a social construct. However, the restriction of sex-gender equivalence is
                                also a social
                                construct. So, would it not be fair to argue that social categorisation is inherently
                                restrictive? Let’s
                                explore this. Suppose you have a gradient of colours. Perhaps it looks like the one

                                <h3>why it matters to remember</h3>
                                <p>cecil richard’s under a star called sun is a reader-led short story about a narrator
                                    where “the
                                    trajectory of [his] ship is unchanging.” he (i like to see myself on the ship; you
                                    may too) recalls that
                                    the coffee “never tastes as good as the ones you get from the cafes back home,” as a
                                    quiet
                                    matter-of-fact.
                                    now, it’s very unlikely that the coffee could be so physically or chemically
                                    different than the ones
                                    here on earth. rather, the difference would make you laugh. i propose it is akin to
                                    how coffee your
                                    loved one makes is always better than starbucks (no offence). it is not the
                                    chemistry of your mug that
                                    matters, but rather the chemistry of your mind. but what is so important about this?
                                    he, remembers what
                                    earth felt like and what a world full of love feels like. even in his solitary
                                    moments with just coffee,
                                    his mind takes the trip back to home. it takes a very lonely astronaut to wish they
                                    were back home. we
                                    usually climb the ladder to the stars when we are alone on the soil.</p>

                                    <p>My week began with a welcome tour of the research facilities at BGS and, more
                                        specifically, the
                                        geochemistry laboratories. The team provided an introduction to the field of
                                        mass spectrometry and the
                                        use of isotopes in archaeological research. The sample preparation, which
                                        happens under very precise,
                                        controlled conditions to exclude contamination, involves a huge amount work
                                        prior to analysis. It wasn’t
                                        long before I was gaining hands-on experience working with carbon isotopes from
                                        organic and inorganic
                                        materials, preparing samples and then analysing them on mass spectrometers. For
                                        me, one of the
                                        highlights was learning how to handle samples down to 40 micrograms in weight —
                                        which I can confirm is
                                        difficult to see with the naked eye!</p>

                                        <h3>How to make a Debating Motion?</h3>
                                        <p> Today we will be talking about motions. I would be using debating terms like
                                            “motion” here and there,
                                            but I will always include a link of that word to my debating terminology
                                            glossary.

                                            Let’s get started. So, what is a motion? Basically, it is the topic which
                                            the debate is about. There are
                                            two sides which would be arguing this (although there could be four teams,
                                            sometimes). Without further
                                            ado, point number one:
                                            1. Balance is Key

                                            The first thing I would suggest you consider is whether there is a balanced
                                            argument to both sides. Can
                                            both sides make a case, can either side win? This is where the real skill of
                                            creating a motion comes
                                            into play. You shouldn’t make a motion where there is a defined answer to,
                                            for example, a motion like
                                            “THBT crime should not be punished”. These are questions which have a
                                            recognised answer to. </p>
