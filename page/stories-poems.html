                    <h3> Masked Figures</h3>
                    <p> (Poem) The pandemic, and the lonliness that stemmed from it, left a large imprint on all of us
                        that survived it. This is for the horrors we all battled with ourselves and fear during then.

                    <p> (Short Story) This is a story of a slow-burn on fast-forward. He is a Physicist and she is a

                    <p> (Poetry) Love often makes us see people in perfect lighting. It reaches a point where even things
                        that used to irritate us, melts us on the inside; this is about the people who melts us. </p>

                    <p> (Poetry) Morality is often thought as a strict "Black and White" concept. However, we must note
                        that, in this world, there is no perfect black and white, but rather that everything is a shade
                        of grey.</p>

                    <h3> Death's Fear </h3>
                    <p> (Poetry) Death is though to be the ultimate villain, the ghost that haunts over our shoulders.
                        This is how death sees some people, and it's never about our pretty little lives. </p>
