            <h3> He Fought for You</h3>
            <p> (Poem) Mahmoud Darwish once wrote, "The wars will end and the leaders will shake hands, [...] I do not
                know who sold the homeland but I know who paid the price." This is for all those who paid the price.

            <h3> Collided Galaxies</h3>
            <p> (Poem) Grief is often raw and remains a sad and tender reminder of the past. It is a soft ache that
                refuses to go away. Maybe in this cosmic dance, you may see someone else's stars embedded in your
                galaxy.

            <h3> A Summer Night Under the Sky</h3>
            <p> (Poem) The stars hide a grand secret we are too stupid to know. But does it ever matter? Does anything hold meaning when you're drunk with love and run over by her beauty?

            <h3> Masked Figures</h3>
            <p> (Poem) The pandemic, and the lonliness that stemmed from it, left a large imprint on all of us
                that survived it. This is for the horrors we all battled with ourselves and fear during then.

            <h3> A Perfect Partner </h3>
            <p> (Poetry) Love often makes us see people in perfect lighting. It reaches a point where even things

            <h3> Black and White </h3>
            <p> (Poetry) Morality is often thought as a strict "Black and White" concept. However, we must note
                that, in this world, there is no perfect black and white, but rather that everything is a shade
                of grey.</p>
