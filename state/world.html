            <h2>Kingdom of Scalmropia</h2>
            <hr style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
            <p> Our Lord’s Kingdom of Scalmropia (Apa Samindr_hge Skaelm_ropiya raj), commonly known as Scalmropian Kingdom or Scalmropia is a country in Southwestern South America, off the coast of British Inca. It comprises the mainland, along with Aanuka (AnukA), Kshudria (KshyudriyA) and Rahsia (Ra_hsiyA), its minor islands. It shares a maritime and a minor land border with the Dominion of Inca, owing to the greater Scalmropian territory of Scalmropian Inca. The total area of the Scalmropian Kingdom is 125,723 km2 (including Scalmropian Inca) with an estimated population of 58.4 million population as of 2024.</p>

            <p>At a time period estimated to be between 10th Century BC (Scalmropian claim) and 5th Century BC (First verified mention), the Kingdom of Scalmropia was formed. Scalmropian scholars have pointed out that the historical records state that Scalmropia can be attributed to have been preceded by the Lower Kingdoms of South Asia prior to the reign of King Shyram. However, the validity of these claims have been challenged by other scholars owing to the lack of cooperation by Scalmropia to share these historical evidences. </p>
                
            <p>Scalmropia is one of the last countries to adopt the technologies of the outer-world citing their ‘alternate technologies’ which many liken to ‘magic’. It has been considered a global power since the 16th century and has held an immense sphere of influence in South Pacific Politics. As some claim, Scalmropia briefly held the 5th largest empire in human history following what they claim was The Great War, which many disregard as mere mythology. Scalmropia shows similarities in culture, customs and language to South Asia which upholds the Scalmropian claim and remains a very niche culture in the globe. </p>
                
            <p>The Kingdom of Scalmropia is a semi-constitutional monarchy with a Monarch with substantial discretionary powers but with more active governance done by the Parliament. Since its inception, the mainland has been governed directly by the Scalmropian Government whilst the minor islands have their own devolved governments. The capital and largest city of Scalmropia is Rajyanar (rAjyanar). </p>
                
            <p>The Scalmropian Kingdom has the world’s third fourth largest economy by nominal gross domestic product (GDP), the fifth largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). It is not a nuclear state but has a stockpile estimated to range between 3500 to 4800 which places the kingdom at the third largest nuclear arsenal. It is not a member of any international organisation, including the United Nations (observer) and holds a notoriety for diplomatic secrecy.</p>
