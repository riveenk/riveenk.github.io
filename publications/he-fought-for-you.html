                <p>Crumbling concrete and the curséd sun<br>
                    The scattered ashes of hope and laughter<br>
                    Lifeless hands grabbing at the broken promises<br>
                    A tuneless whistle haunting the air</p>

                <p>Yet there still lies a warrior<br>
                    Pleading to God, bargaining with the devil<br>
                    For he waits for the smiles he left<br>
                    That is his flower and his pod</p>

                <p>It cost half a soul for him to leave<br>
                    Leave home in mercy of others<br>
                    At every tear he sheds<br>
                    Every bullet that leaves his barrel<br>
                    It costs another ever increasing tax</p>

                <p>Every night, he stared into the stars, sleepless,<br>
                    Constellations make up faces he sent to god<br>
                    The tuneless whistle still plays at his ear<br>
                    For the cost is hefty for a blossomed home</p>

                <p>Every day, he danced to the tuneless whistle<br>
                    And he realised, he'd been whistling all along<br>
                    What a lonely sadist ambition is, making you<br>
                    Sing through the screams and dance to its tune</p>

                <p>He still fought to see another day, an<br>
                    Ambiguous promise for a happily ever after<br>
                    The air feels stale to breathe,<br>
                    The flowers whisper a sob-tale</p>

                <p>But the sob-tale hails the dead warrior’s soul<br>
                    And the dead still dreams of what he lost:<br>
                    Running home, seeing the sun rise tomorrow<br>
                    Cheering on for the desperate victory<br>
                    Holding their hands, warm and alive<br>
                    Ignoring the corpses that lay beneath his feet</p>
