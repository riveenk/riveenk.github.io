        <p>
            A dark void appears from the lengths<br />Of my sight: An uncommon sight,
            both to man<br />And to the dead. Death.<br />And from, a frightened pair of
            gleaming eyes<br />Lies affixed on my bloody hands, horrified;<br />Her
            scythe clutched, twined with her fingers<br />While my delicate tools loosen
            free from mine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then I take a step back, another, and another,<br />So she could check what
            soul she could salvage<br />From my beautiful art of blood, meat and
            bones<br />To see if she could best my artwork with her<br />Expertise; yet
            I see her hands twitch and tremble<br />Still in fear and agitation. I'm
            Surprised.
          </p>
          <p>
            I then think of moments earlier, as I was carving<br />Into the body of my
            friend, remaking, repainting <br />The works of God inside with my scalpel.
            Euphoric.<br />Even then I knew who was lurking outside my<br />Peripheral;
            She was too pure a void to miss.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, she stands up and looks to her side as if<br />My model is with her...
            My own artwork.<br />She pauses, then tears stream from her eyes <br />Into
            the darkness of the cloak<br />And then she bursts into tears. Sad. Angry.
            Afraid.
          </p>
          <p>And I?<br />I smile. <br />I laugh.</p>
