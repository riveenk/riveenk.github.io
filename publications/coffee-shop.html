        <hr>
        <p>You are sitting by the window,<br />
            Book in hand, your coffee clentched-<br />
            Eyes roaming around worlds of high fantasy <br />
            And magic and crime and mystery and thrill.<br />
            <br />
            From across the room I'm reading you,<br />
            Happy. Sad. Amazed. Afraid. The feelings<br />
            flowing fluid inside me interchanging<br />
            With and across one another: Tangled.<br />
            <br />
            I'm staring and it's obvious: Eyes-Book-Coffee-Eyes;<br />
            People notice: Book-Eyes-Coffee-Eyes;<br />
            You notice: Book-Eyes-Coffee-Eyes-Eyes;<br />
            You smile: Eyes-Smile-Smile-Eyes.<br />
            <br />
            You stand up, and walk... towards me (And<br />
            I'm screaming inside) - then past me...<br />
            (What??? [that is not supposed to happen] Why???<br />
            [Maybe she missed? (forgot? -how?)] Why???)<br />
            And from behind, a hand- it's you.<br />
            Your warm and soft and welcoming hand.<br />
            I take it - with you, and walk out the cafe;<br />
            To write our own story. Together.</p>
