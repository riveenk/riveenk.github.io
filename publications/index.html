            <p> (Blog) This is my Tumblr for mini-blogging. Posts here would be much shorter, and perhaps more frequent.
                Many posts would involve rants, movies/ books reviews, and short writings.

            <p> (Poem) As someone who has lived through the end of a civil war, yet at great relative safety, it was very easy to be disillusioned. The horror of war is not a myth, but many wish it was and many think it is.

            <h3>Maybe the Gods are playing Cricket</h3>
            <p> (Poem) As a child, I liked to imagine the scary and loud thunderstorms were just cricket matches in heaven. There was a sense of comfort in it, but also felt gross to be under the rain.

            <h3> You'll Love Me</h3>
            <p> (Poem) It's easy to tell someone to love themselves, much easier than loving them yourself. This is for
                those of us who need that little push, that little hug to hold them from falling.

                idiots? Yeah, me too. This is for my goof balls (they'll hate me for calling them that).

            <h3> He Fought for You</h3>
            <p> (Poem) Mahmoud Darwish once wrote, "The wars will end and the leaders will shake hands, [...] I do not
                know who sold the homeland but I know who paid the price." This is for all those who paid the price.

            <h3> Collided Galaxies</h3>
            <p> (Poem) Grief is often raw and remains a sad and tender reminder of the past. It is a soft ache that
                refuses to go away. Maybe in this cosmic dance, you may see someone else's stars embedded in your
                galaxy.

                hold meaning when you're drunk with love and run over by her beauty?

                that survived it. This is for the horrors we all battled with ourselves and fear during then.

                that, in this world, there is no perfect black and white, but rather that everything is a shade
                of grey.</p>
