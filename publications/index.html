            <h3>Tumblr Blog</h3>
            <p> (Blog) This is my Tumblr for mini-blogging. Posts here would be much shorter, and perhaps more frequent.
                Many posts would involve rants, movies/ books reviews, and short writings.

                Scalmropia. This is where much of the world-building is concentrated.

            <h3> You'll Love You</h3>
            <p> (Poem) It's easy to tell someone to love themselves, much easier than loving them yourself. This is for
                those of us who need that little push, that little hug to hold them from falling.

            <h3> Maybe in a Few Years</h3>
            <p> (Poem) Do ever think of your friends two minutes to midnight and only feel unreserved love for those
                idiots? Yeah, me too. This is for my goof balls (they'll hate me for calling them that).

            <h3> He Fought for You</h3>
            <p> (Poem) Mahmoud Darwish once wrote, "The wars will end and the leaders will shake hands, [...] I do not
                know who sold the homeland but I know who paid the price." This is for all those who paid the price.

            <h3> Collided Galaxies</h3>
            <p> (Poem) Grief is often raw and remains a sad and tender reminder of the past. It is a soft ache that
                refuses to go away. Maybe in this cosmic dance, you may see someone else's stars embedded in your
                galaxy.

            <h3> A Summer Night Under the Moon</h3>
            <p> (Poem) The stars hide a grand secret we are too stupid to know. But does it ever matter? Does anything
                hold meaning when you're drunk with love and run over by her beauty?

            <h3> Masked Figures</h3>
            <p> (Poem) The pandemic, and the lonliness that stemmed from it, left a large imprint on all of us
                that survived it. This is for the horrors we all battled with ourselves and fear during then.

                Philosopher, and they both end up finding that there's more that attracts than Gravity. </p>

            <h3> A Perfect Partner </h3>
            <p> (Poetry) Love often makes us see people in perfect lighting. It reaches a point where even things
                that used to irritate us, melts us on the inside; this is about the people who melts us. </p>

            <h3> Black and White </h3>
            <p> (Poetry) Morality is often thought as a strict "Black and White" concept. However, we must note
                that, in this world, there is no perfect black and white, but rather that everything is a shade
                of grey.</p>

            <h3> Death's Fear </h3>
            <p> (Poetry) Death is though to be the ultimate villain, the ghost that haunts over our shoulders.
                This is how death sees some people, and it's never about our pretty little lives. </p>
