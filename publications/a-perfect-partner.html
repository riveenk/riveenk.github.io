            <p>A perfect partner can never be found
                <br />For no such thing exists on Earth,
                <br />And those who seem truly profound
                <br />Are perfection driven, by your eye's mirth,
                <br />Perception lacks the truth that's bound.
            </p>
            <p>A myriad of quirks, some you hate,
                <br />Shapes and forms the soul you love.
                <br />The songs they hum all day, you hate;
                <br />And the glass indent that you love,
                <br />Are not the marks of a perfect mate.
            </p>
            <p>This is not advice to be sought,
                <br />For the love of your life waits to be found.
                <br />The path is easy, no battle to be fought,
                <br />And they're waiting for you to come around;
                <br />For rain and hail both end a drought.
            </p>
            <p>And when the years have gone,
                <br />The rose-tint of your eyes long lost,
                <br />Never once should you mourn,
                <br />The 'perfection' you saw, long lost.
            </p>
            <p>So, if you ever find yourself falling in love,
                <br />Build a world with promise with them,
                <br />Instead of searching for perfection unknown.
            </p>
            <p>And that is why a perfect partner,
                <br />Exists only in ink.
