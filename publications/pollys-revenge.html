        <br><br>
        <p>Summer was slowly turning into autumn, and days were increasingly spent alone at home. With the warm invitation in the air slowly receding, most of the door knocks were from the mailman, rarely a friend. On one such day, Polly was sitting on her couch, mindlessly scrolling up and down on social media. Amongst hundreds of pictures and videos that didn’t stay on screen for more than five seconds, she stumbles on a picture that she loves: Kyle, her friend, and most importantly, the one she secretly likes.</p>
        <p>He looks cute in this, she thought, and for some unknown reason, she felt confident enough to confess her feelings to Kyle. When he agrees, we can make a surprise entrance tomorrow, and it’ll be our first date night too, she thought. She opened his contact and began typing. </p>
        <p>After five minutes and two-hundred-thirty-six neatly woven words from the most vulnerable depths of her heart, her finger hovered over the ‘send’ button. She let out a quick sigh, took a long breath in, and clicked ‘send’. One tick, two ticks. She kept her phone on the table and went to the kitchen to get a glass of water. After that, just as she was about to put the mug back, her doorbell rang. She looked over to the door, kept the mug down, and walked to the door. She opened the door; there was no one. She looked around, then looked down. There was a box covered in gift wrapping; it had a label: To Polly. She looked around again, lightly nudged the box with her foot, then took it inside.</p>
        <p>The box was heavy and very neatly wrapped. She took it with her to the couch, sat down, and began unwrapping the box. In a few rips, the parcel was unwrapped. She opened the box. Inside, much to her confusion, was a typewriter. She took it out. And there was a piece of paper on it. It read: It’s 4:38 pm, you are confused about this. You are wearing a purple and white striped knit top and a pair of blue jeans. You will look at the time in a moment, it’s 4:39 pm then. You will also receive a reply from Kyle. It’s not good.</p>
        <p>And then Polly checked the time; it was 4:39. Immediately, she received a reply from Kyle. She only saw the laugh emojis. She immediately opened the text.</p>
        <p> Polly r u serious??<br><br>
            😂😂😂</p>

        <p>Polly felt her eyes watering, and she didn’t see that a notification had popped up from the group chat. She kept staring at the laugh emojis. Then her phone began to buzz frantically from the bombardment of messages from the group chat. Confused, she opened it. </p>

        <p>         Kyle:    <br><br>Sent an attachment<br><br>
            Bro is she serious?</p>
        
        <p>He had shared a screenshot with the entire group. And they were not being pleasant to Polly either: “Damn, burnn”, “Bro, what was she thinking?” and “Look in the mirror, Polly.” She immediately broke into tears. Then, as she was trying to throw her phone, the typewriter began writing: Polly, throw it and it will break, but it won’t sooth your heart’s ache. Prompted by this, a new decision you will make, one that will betray the traitors like a snake.
        <br><br>This shook Polly down to the spine. But her sadness overtook all her fears. She clutched the phone as quickly as possible and then dropped to the couch, curled up, and cried.</p>

        <p>
            At 5:13, she sat upright, eyes red from crying, her hair messy. She looked at the typewriter with new-found curiosity. There was new text typed on it: The time is 5:13, and you are curious. Let me show what I can do. Take a coin and flip it ten times and two. I will predict the result for six-fold chances, and you may type in the result for the remainder. So, she did. She took a coin and flipped it six times, only to be amazed at how the typewriter correctly predicted it. Then, as suggested, she typed in six more results to see if it actually worked.
<br><br>
First flip, it worked. Second flip, it worked. Third, fourth, and fifth flips worked too. Then Polly tried something. She intentionally dropped the coin on the opposite side of which she predicted, and somehow, after it landed, the coin had the predicted side up. She was sure beyond doubt that the typewriter could predict the future.
<br><br>
I wish I was more beautiful, she then typed in. A reply came back: I simply provide ink for the future to be written; hence, I am unable to twist the past. She was disappointed. The typewriter went on: My page is almost over; replace it soon to yield reign over tomorrow, think wisely and ask from me the right thing to rid you of your sorrow. Polly hurried to her room and brought back a blank sheet of paper. Ten minutes of struggling and two more blank pages later, the page was put in. 
<br><br>
Polly tried again: In five minutes, I will cover my eyes and walk to the kitchen. There I will mix into a pot the never before known ingredients of eternal youth and maddening beauty. This time the entry worked: Very well, wielder of tomorrow, you shall chant the words of blessings prior. Vita numquam aspiciet, numquam pulchritudinem relinquet. Cum armagedon venerit solus ego fortis et ego solus Venerem Aemulabo decorem.
<br><br>
She struggled at first, but by five minutes, she had recited the blessings and covered her eyes. She walked into the kitchen. What she mixed into the pot; we don’t know. The turmeric had an unknown green radiance, and the water from the tap looked red, so no other person will ever make this portion. She felt dizzy. She dropped unconscious.
<br><br>
When she woke up, it was morning. She was on the couch, and there was something very different about her. She could feel it. There was yet another message from the typewriter: Rise and shine; glow in your greater beauty. Admire the changes and plot the evening, maybe take revenge. And that is exactly what she did; she spent the entire morning writing how the evening would go.
        </p>
        <p>
            ***<br>
Evening came around, and she checked the ‘plot’ to be sure she was at the right time to see the right thing. She could finally fit in her ‘more beautiful’ clothing. Even she couldn’t stop looking at herself in the mirror. 
<br><br>
When she got to the park, as planned. No one recognised her at first. So, she had to awkwardly stand near the group until Matthew called Polly, and the phone rang from the attractive girl nearby. Polly took it. <br><br>
        “Hey, where a-” Matthew stopped, realising she had been here the whole time, “Jesus Christ, Polly! Damn, I mean,” it was evident Matthew had noticed. <br>
        “Oh my gosh, Polly, you came!” Sabrina said, with false friendliness. Her jaw dropped when she saw Polly. So did Kyle’s and Mellissa’s.
<br><br>
Judging by how and where the boys’ and Mellissa’s eyes occasionally roamed, Polly was more than sure that the trick had worked. She just had to play along for a while to get her full revenge. Enjoy a bit now so that she can enjoy a lot more later. <br><br>
        “Let’s check out the spinning wheel first.” <br><br>

So, they went to the spinning wheel. But at the last minute, Sabrina said that she couldn’t go on the ride. Already knowing that everything is happening on script, Polly ‘decided’ to stay back ‘for Sabrina’s safety’. Once the ride began, Polly decided to begin her first killing. <br><br>
        “Hey, wanna get an ice cream?” She asked in faux innocence. <br>
        “Oh, yeah. Sure.” <br><br>
So, they went to get ice cream. Once they bought them, Polly suggested ‘having them in peace’, and they went near a secluded tent. They finished the ice cream, and just then, an unknown hand dragged Sabrina inside the tent. Polly, knowing this was on plan, walked inside. As planned, there was a person dressed as a clown who had already gagged Sabrina with a piece of cloth, was tying her hands to the nearby table. <br><br>

        Sabrina let out a muffled cry that was barely understandable as, “Help me.” <br>
        Polly just gave a wicked smile in reply. She walked at a frighteningly slow pace and bent down nearby Sabrina, “What did you say yesterday, Sabbie?” <br>
        No reply came from the mortified girl. <br>
        “You told me to look in the mirror, Sabbie. This was yesterday. Can’t you remember?” She then signalled the clown to bring a mirror in front of her. “I know you are horrified by clowns, so I specially arranged this for you.” She gave a thumbs up to the clown. <br><br>

        The clown first took out a pair of scissors and began to cut off her eyelids. The gagging was so good that, all that came out was a light, muffled sob. <br>
        “That is for you to see yourself properly.” <br>
        Then the clown took out a pocket knife and cut off her nose, then her ears, and finally her lips. But the party was far from over. Then the clown began to carve the flesh off Sabrina’s face. Now the cries were a bit louder; Polly wanted it that way. She began laughing. After leaving behind an almost bare skull, almost devoid of muscle,  
        “Shower time!” Polly prompted the clown, who brushed two fingers on Sabrina’s neck to find an artery and slashed it in a swift motion. Blood was spraying everywhere. The clown’s hand was covered in it, and he rubbed the blood on her face and hands as if it were an essential oil treatment at a spa. <br>
        “Do whatever you want with her,” Polly said, and she left. <br><br>

She came out of the tent and soon mixed into the crowd. She walked towards the spin wheel, knowing that the remaining trio would be standing there. <br>
        “Oh, there you are,” Melissa said. <br>
        “Yeah, Sabrina wanted to get ice cream, then she went to the toilets. I waited for twenty minutes; she isn’t even answering her phone.” <br>
        “Oh, is she okay? Was anyone suspicious around?” Matthew asked, wanting to impress Polly. <br>
        “Oh no, no, I’ll call you if anything goes wrong,” then Polly winked at Matthew. This was unusually open behaviour from her, but Matthew did enjoy it. <br><br>
Polly walked Melissa towards the bathroom stalls—not the ones being used here at the circus, but rather the secluded ones at the far, lonely corners. <br>
        “Are you sure we are on the right way?” Melissa asked. <br>
        “Yeah, yeah. We tried the normal stalls, but they were full, so we asked a guy at a vendor stall, who told us about here.” These were obviously lies, but Polly wanted the remainder of the revenge to be done with her own hands. They were all likeable people, ones that Polly would’ve even considered a relationship beyond just friends had circumstances been different. But for now, she just put a hand over her shoulder, gave a light squeeze of faux reassurance, and walked her towards the stalls. <br><br>

The stalls were secluded and had the look of neglect, with mouldy growth and putrid smells. “Yeah, this was a last resort. I’ll go check first; you stay here.” Polly went in, walked towards the furthest door, opened it, and said, “Oh, Sabbie, are you alright. The door is unlocked too. You don’t look very well. Wait, lemme call in Melissa,” then she turned and said loudly, “Melissa! Come here!” <br><br>
Melissa, not knowing about the doom she had yet to go through, walked quickly towards Polly. Polly was standing in such a way that when Melissa came, she had to go past her to see the inside and couldn’t get away as Polly was barricading. <br>
        She looked inside and said, “Wait, there’s no one inside.”
        “Surprise!” Polly said and pushed Melissa inside. She came in and locked the door.
        “Oh, oh, if you wanted something... You could’ve just asked.” Melissa said with a smirk, “Then we could’ve done things differently.”
        Then Polly put her right hand on Melissa’s cheek, slowly brushed it down her face and then down her neck. Melissa, unaware of what was about to happen to her, closed her eyes. Then, Polly began choking her. 
        “Oh, you’re into that stuff…” Melissa said, still under the belief that she was here for a secret endeavour. The endeavour was secret, but not in the way Melissa expected. 
       Then Polly took out a pocket knife, and began stabbing her in the neck. Repeatedly. There was an attempt to speak or even scream for help, but the strongest message that came out was fear in her eyes. While Melissa was slowly choking from the severed wind-pipe and her lungs were filling with blood, Polly switched from the knife blade to the cork opener. Then she began screwing into Melissa’s temple, 
“Remember what you said yesterday? She asked, “‘Bro, what was she thinking?’” She said, mockingly. “Now can you think? Not for long.” 
        Polly let the pocket knife—lodged in Melissa’s head stay as it is and said, “I saw how you looked at me today. Do you like it?” While slowly keeping both of her hands on Melissa’s face. In the absence of a reply, she said, “Well, take one last look,” and pressed her thumbs into Melissa’s eyes. 

She wiped her bloody hands on Melissa’s skirt, pulled out her pocket knife, and called Matthew.
         “Hey, Matthew…” She was luring him in.
         “Polly? Are you alright?”
         “I’m alright. The girls decided to leave and I am bored…”
         “Oh, oh… Want me to come over?”
         “Obviously,” she said, giving him directions to meet her at the same bathroom stalls and hanging up with an audible kiss. 

 “You kicked out a great chance, mate.” Matthew said to Kyle, “I’m about to get lucky,” and left. Just then, Kyle received a message from Polly, “Got Matthew out of the picture, wanna make today our first date?” He was mesmerised by this but nevertheless impressed. “Yesss,” he replied. “Cool, I’ll text you in fifteen, then come here. www.mymap.com/kjbLk,” it was a pin for an old ballroom nearby. “Let’s make day one romantic,” she sent. Kyle decided to get a wine and a whisky, to set the atmosphere and in case he could get lucky—all according to Polly’s script.

Matthew was at the place by now. He looked around. The surroundings looked even more unsettling. The sun was almost down, and the shadows seemed to play games with him. But lust is stronger than fear, so he called out, “Polly!” 

Suddenly, he felt a hit on his head, a piercing pain. He dropped to the ground, holding his head. He was bleeding. “What? Who is there?” His vision was blurry. Then he saw a figure standing over him. 
        It crouched down and said, “Matthew…” 
        “Polly?” he asked. 
        “Yours truly.”
        “What’s happening?”
        “I’m killing you.” 
        He laughed, “I didn’t think you liked BDSM stuff, but this is too much.”
        “Come on, I am enjoying myself here. Not you, of course, but warm blood just feels so good.” She then opened the bottle of bleach from the bathroom and poured it on Matthews’ open wound and eyes. He screamed in pain. “Remember what you said yesterday? ‘Ooh Burn!’ Now guess who is burning!”
        “You are such a worthless ugl-” Matthew was cut off when Polly shoved the open bleach bottle into his mouth. He was choking and screaming in pain as the bleach burned his innards. Polly then took out her pocket knife and stabbed him in the chest, until his chest was an unholy salad of cloth, meat, and blood. She just smiled as the blood ebbed from his chest. She then cut open his abdomen, put her hands in, and felt around—how the organs felt, the warmth of blood. She took her hands out and wiped the blood on her face, neck, and arms. She slit his wrists open and let the adrenaline pumped veins and arteries shower her in blood. And when the blood finally ran out and Matthew’s life—long departed, Polly was slick in blood, her clothes sticking on to her, taking her natural shape. She looked like a statue of garnet, with marble impurities showing in her uncovered skin—free from blood. She walked in the slow grace of a dangerous predator towards the old ballroom.

Kyle was starting to feel impatient now. Where is she? he thought. Rational thought often leaves a person when lust is involved, so he sat there, dreaming about how the night would go. He was staring at the lightly discoloured white walls of the ballroom illuminated by moonlight when he saw a redness that contrasted with the walls and reached closer to him.
        “Polly?”
        “Yes, my love.” 
        “What happened?”
        “Nothing,” she said, already within arm’s reach. She slowly brought her hand to her face, smiled innocently, batted her eyes, and licked one of the bloody fingers. She slowly smiled again. She kept the clean finger on Kyle’s face, brushed it down his face, and held his face by the chin.
        His mind was filled with the wildest fantasies at the moment. His eyes scanned over the bloody yet well-defined curves of Polly’s body. He never saw them earlier. He was regretting his decision yesterday. He pushed her towards the wall and tried to kiss her. But she stopped him, saying, “I see you brought drinks… I am so thirsty.”
        “Yes, yes, we can do this later. Let me set the scene.” He walked her over to the table with the drinks and asked, “What do you prefer?”
        Without a reply, she grabbed the whisky bottle, said, “Hmm, 1965,” opened it, and began drinking it off the bottle in huge gulps. In a minute, the bottle was empty.
        “Now, we can get down to what we really came here for,” Polly said, breaking the bottle. The perfect weapon. She then stood up and sat on Kyle’s lap. “Are you ready?”
        “Y- Y- Yes,” Kyle stammered, but he’s never had such an endeavour. He closed his eyes and bent forward for a kiss. Polly laughed in her mind about how lust-driven he is and suddenly stabbed him in the neck. He let out a scream. She stood up. “What are you doing?”
        The reply was another stab to the other side of his neck. He dropped to the floor. Polly laughed and opened the wine bottle, took two gulps, and then poured the remainder on her body. The half-way rigid, blood slick clothes were now again dark red and stuck on her. She threw the bottle away.

She walked towards the bleeding Kyle on the floor, sat on the floor beside him, and stabbed him repeatedly until she felt it was enough. He was already dead, and his body had the consistency of mashed potatoes. Blood was everywhere. She then looked at Kyle, gave his body a firm hug until the blood was soaked in, and was happy with her revenge. She looked at her bloody hand, licked the fingers, and laughed.

She could then hear the bells from a nearby church, indicating that it was nine at night. Right on plan, she thought, as she slowly faded away and reappeared on her couch at home. She was greeted with a message from the typewriter: The time is 9:01 and the smell of blood and wine spreads over your house. In five minutes, you will clean yourself up and have no worries about the murders you committed. No one will remember seeing you at the circus, and your neighbours will testify for you. Enjoy the eternal high of everlasting beauty and unrestrained entertainment. Put this letter in your backyard, unless you want your hand burned too.

She crumpled the blood-stained paper, threw it in her backyard, and went to get cleaned.
