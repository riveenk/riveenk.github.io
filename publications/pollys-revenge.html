        <p>Autumn is a very lonely season. After a lively Summer, everyone is tired and days are increasingly spent alone. On just another early autumn morning, Polly spent the first few hours of the day staring at Kyle’s pictures. Kyle was her friend, bilaterally, and her crush, unilaterally. Despite her reservations, she feels confident enough to approach the topic today. She imagines them making a surprise reveal at the group outing and even have a date night afterwards. So she types; two hundred and thirty seven words in seven minutes and forty two seconds. It was a gamble, and yet, with little hesitation, she clicked ‘send’.</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;"> One tick.<br>
Two ticks.</span><br>
She went to get a glass of water.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;"> Typing… </span></p>

<p>That’s when she heard the doorbell ring. On an ordinary day, one wouldn’t hear that, and her doorbell wouldn’t be so quiet. But she still walked over to her door, opened it and saw no one. She looked both ways and finally looked down to see a cardboard box on her doorstep. She nudged it with her foot; it was quite heavy. She didn’t notice any mailing stamps either, but reluctantly took it in.</p>

<p>It was a very neatly, yet meticulously wrapped box. She brought it to her table, and with a pair of scissors, began undoing the wrapping. Soon, much to her confusion, she found a vintage typewriter inside. There was a paper already attached, with something typed. It read: “Kyle has responded, Polly. Unfortunately, it’s bad.”</p>

<p>Even more confused, Polly reached towards her phone when it began to frantically buzz with notifications. She ignored them, not noticing that they were from the group chat and immediately opened Kyle’s texts.</p>

<table style="font: inherit; font-size: inherit; color: inherit;">
    <tr>
        <td>Kyle:</td>
        <td>Polly are u serious?? <span style="font-style: normal;"> 😂😂😂 </span></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p>She was on the verge of tears, but kept on staring at the rash and humiliating reply. She couldn’t stop the anger welling up inside her. She was distracted by a new message in the group chat.</p>

<table style="font: inherit; font-size: inherit; color: inherit;">
    <tr>
        <td>Kyle:</td>
        <td> <span style="font-style: normal;"> 📷 </span> Sent an attachment</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Matt:</td>
        <td>Damnn burnn</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Mel:</td>
        <td>Bro what was she thinking?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Sabi:</td>
        <td>Look in the mirror gurl</td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p>She could not stop the tears now. She tried to throw away her phone, but the ‘ting’ of the typewriter startled her. There was new writing: “The phone did nothing wrong to you, it has no feelings. Get your feelings out first.” Although this mortified her to the core, she was too sad to care. She curled up and cried; until she fell asleep.</p>
