            <h4 class="body-subheader"> Type: Essay | 21 April, 2025</h4>
            <hr>

            <p>For much of recorded history, gender and sex were used interchangeably: male meant XY chromosomes and
                masculinity, female meant XX chromosomes and femininity. However, modern gender has evolved into a
                broader and more nuanced spectrum—some sources listing dozens—if not hundreds—of uniquely defined
                identities. This essay examines the nature of gender, and argues for abolishing gender as a descriptive
                identifying term.</p>

            <p>Historically, and even now in some societies, gender was a binary. I, myself, have seen and experienced
                what it feels like to be a part of such a society. Modern definition of “gender” has evolved away from
                “sex” into a social construct. However, the restriction of sex-gender equivalence is also a social
                construct. So, would it not be fair to argue that social categorisation is inherently restrictive? Let’s
                explore this. Suppose you have a gradient of colours. Perhaps it looks like the one below:</p>

            <div class="gradient" style="background-image: url(/media/colour-gradient.png);"></div>

            <p>If we categorise this into just two parts, we can choose between most blue and most red.</p>

            <div class="gradient" style="background-image: url(/media/colour-gradient-split.png);"></div>

            <p>But evidently, even we can see that the red part actually includes red, orange, pink (ish), and bits of
                yellow and bits of magenta. The blue part actually includes green, cyan, blue, violet, and bits of
                yellow and bits of magenta. So we will do better justice and split it into some major colours.</p>

            <div class="gradient" style="background-image: url(/media/colour-gradient.png); filter: contrast(100);">
            </div>

            <p>Even if we ignored the obvious bleed of neighbouring colours into the other, what about different shades
                of these colours? </p>

            <div class="gradient"
                style="background-image: url(/media/colour-gradient.png); filter: contrast(100); opacity: 30%;"></div>


            <p>But these blocks of colours are not representative of what these colours actually are. So, if you want
                to actually do justice to all the colours of the gradient, you have to keep splitting it into smaller
                and smaller groups.</p>

            <div class="gradient" style="background-image: url(/media/colour-gradient.png);"></div>
            <div class="gradient"
                style="background: linear-gradient(to right, #ff1803, #ffd500); margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></div>
            <div class="gradient" style="background: linear-gradient(to right, #ff5600, #ff6400, #ff7400);"></div>


            <p>Despite these splits, and the fact that the last strip seems the same, it is still a gradient: </p>

            <div class="gradient" style="background: linear-gradient(to right, #ff5600, #ff6400, #ff7400);"></div>
                <table style="width: 80%; font-family: inherit; color: inherit; font-size: small; padding: 0%; margin-top: 0px; border-color: transparent;">
                    <tr style="border-color: transparent;">
                        <td style="border-color: transparent; text-align: left;">  #ff5600 </td>
                        <td style="border-color: transparent;"> #ff6400 </td>
                        <td style="border-color: transparent; text-align: right;"> #ff7400 </td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

            <p>So, the only way to do proper justice to the identity of a colour would be to describe them individually
                and specifically. For example, “green” would mean this: </p>

            <div class="color-grid">
                <div style="background-color: #013220;"></div>
                <div style="background-color: #004225;"></div>
                <div style="background-color: #1e4d2b;"></div>
                <div style="background-color: #1b2d3e;"></div>
                <div style="background-color: #177245;"></div>
                <div style="background-color: #4a5d23;"></div>
                <div style="background-color: #2e8b27;"></div>
                <div style="background-color: #317873;"></div>
                <div style="background-color: #40826d;"></div>
                <div style="background-color: #138808;"></div>
                <div style="background-color: #9acd32;"></div>
                <div style="background-color: #55dd33;"></div>
                <div style="background-color: #00ff7f;"></div>
                <div style="background-color: #e3f988;"></div>
                <div style="background-color: #d0f0c0;"></div>
            </div>

            <p>But this doesn’t even include the normally known “green” colour. It is obvious that this palette does not
                include our intuitive range of “green”s. Similarly, some of us may not consider some colours here to be
                green (personally, 4th column 3rd row doesn’t feel exactly green). </p>

            <p>Now, you may have realised what my extended metaphor was inching towards. Yes, I intended to use it as an
                allegory for gender. The traditional definition of gender was too binary to do justice for all the
                hues—let alone the shades. The modern definition is akin to the split into major colours, because
                ultimately variation still exists within these genders, and no definition would ever be enough to
                describe all in a particular gender group. Unless, of course, you reduce the size of the split to be so
                small that each would only hold a handful. </p>

            <p>This leads me to ask: why should we spend so much effort on defining gender? Anchoring gender so heavily
                on identity was perhaps a limitation of a learning society—a limitation we can evolve beyond. I propose
                that gender and even sexuality are deeply personal orientations, just like one’s favourite colour,
                perhaps reductively. It is only a piece of personal preference, right? One would say, “my preferred
                pronouns are [...],” or “I find [...] attractive”. So, why assign undue value to this preference? </p>

            <p>Many gender-activists support ideas like pronouns, social acceptance, legal definitions, etc. However, a
                main limitation in this cause is partly contextual and partly of their misguidance. One of the main
                reasons why I struggled to understand the concept of preferred pronouns was because my native language,
                Sinhala, commonly uses no gendered pronouns in colloquial use. It was reserved as a formality. So, the
                struggle to self-identify, sometimes, is only the fault of our undue focus on gender in language. I have
                come to realise that some languages already hold linguistic compatibility for gender neutrality. We
                could perfectly use genderless or gender-neutral pronouns (some languages do not even have gendered
                pronouns). Surely, it is wrong for me to blame society for having gendered pronouns. However, I will
                argue that evolving beyond that is possible. Many languages without gender neutrality are experimenting
                and/or evolving neopronouns for it.
            </p>

            <p>Furthermore, the struggle for social acceptance has activists fighting for social perception as their own
                identities. However, this social expectation often revolves about the fact that society cares far more
                about social perception of gender than it should. In this lies both the support and opposition for
                modern-gender politics. Suppose one’s favourite colour was a personal identifier (likened to gender) and
                they wear only their favourite colour (likened to gender-identity). The social conflict lies in the fact
                that the majority likes red or blue, and they are not happy to produce clothes in other colours (hence
                the need for activism). My proposition is to remove the need to wear only your favourite colour. Let
                clothing be a choice, not a label. Perhaps accessorising it would reflect preference without defining
                you with it. You can remove gender from language, but retain it as a personal preference. You would
                never introduce yourself with, “Hello, I am [...]. My favourite colour is [...]”.
            </p>

            <p>Finally, another clash lies in the fact that some public infrastructure is built around gender and sex.
                Some fault lies among a minority of activists who mistake gender and sex—they regard gender change
                (surgically reassigned, or otherwise) as equivalent to a sex change. This leads to some people sharing
                their gender, not biological sex in medical, or research settings—and facing non-ideal consequences.
                Furthermore, a more sensitive topic is washrooms. Main concerns that oppose gender neutral bathrooms are
                fears of assault, personal disdain. However, the same concerns echo past social concerns that justified
                segregation. Equality often challenges the status quo and discomfort is not always rational evidence for
                exclusion. It’s almost as if it makes no difference whether you split bathrooms by gender or not. One
                does their business as their boundaries or capabilities permit, at a urinal or a stall. If one wishes to
                exploit the vulnerability of a bathroom, a mere label of Men-Women in bathrooms makes no difference.
            </p>

            <p>So, to reiterate my case: Gender identity is so complex that categorising will never do justice to its
                inhabitants. This would set off a social trend of repeatedly adding more categories until
                gender-identity would be so varied that it would be as arbitrary as asking one of their favourite colour
                is. The answer could be as wide as green or as specific as <span
                    style="font-family: consolas;">#008080</span>. This is more suffocating for a society bound to
                gender identity than freeing. A post-gender society would allow individuals to practice their own gender
                identity, revealing as much or as little as one needs. Gender identity would not exist. Gender wars
                would not exist. Gender oppression would not exist. Even attraction and romance could be independent of
                gender.

            <p style="font-size: small;">This is a personal and philosophical exploration of gender as a social construct. I intend no disrespect and, supports and upholds the legal and moral rights of all people of all gender identities and sexualities. Metaphors used in the essay are only for illustrative purposes and I do not intend on portraying them in equivalence. </p>
