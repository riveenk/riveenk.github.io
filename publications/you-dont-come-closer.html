                <p>
                    Frosty hints in the ruthless air,<br>
                    No nights like this ever turned fair.<br>
                    The trees are bare—it's almost December.<br>
                    This eve will be one to remember.</p>
                <p>

                    You don't come closer, or hold my hand.<br>
                    You pretend you don't notice a strand<br>
                    begins to run down my face,<br>
                    or sense that my heart has begun to race.</p>
                <p>

                    The coffee is cold, just like my mother.<br>
                    It burns my lips when I beg it to smother<br>
                    my racing heart with too much caffeine.<br>
                    Yet fails to warm when the frost is mean.</p>
                <p>

                    The food is absent, just like my father.<br>
                    It will arrive when the hunger doesn't bother<br>
                    anymore and I'm half full with my cold coffee.<br>
                    I can barely have anything bigger than a toffee.</p>
                <p>

                    You don't come closer, or flinch too hard.<br>
                    But you tap your fingers like you'd guard<br>
                    my scarred heart until it all healed<br>
                    and no more of raw wounds stay revealed.</p>
                <p>

                    Am I bothering you? Is this too much?<br>
                    I'd hate myself to use you as a crutch.<br>
                    I've never told this much about me<br>
                    to anyone, because there's always a fee.</p>
                <p>

                    You don't come closer, or tap your feet anymore.<br>
                    You look down like you'd scrape the whole floor<br>
                    just to collect the broken pieces of my soul<br>
                    and glue it all together to make me whole.</p>
                <p>

                    The food arrives, a warm bowl of mac and cheese.<br>
                    But I can't eat more and keep my belly at ease.<br>
                    You can have it, maybe this is your fee.<br>
                    I think I'll have a nice cup of tea.</p>
                <p>

                    I dread going home—it's almost December.<br>
                    But this night has been one to remember.<br>
                    I'll let you watch me finish my tea,<br>
                    and secretly hope you, too, hate me.
