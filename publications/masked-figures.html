                    I saw the uninhabited road, filled of masked figures, <br>
                    I went to the kitchen, made a coffee, and smiled. <br>
                    I took to the sheets and cried myself to sleep <br>
                    I dreamt myself dead, flowers growing out of me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was watering my plants the other day, when <br>
                    I realised that my plants were dead, <br>
                    I imagine my dead children growing out of me. </p>
                <p>
                    I am staring at a masked figure and I don’t know. Should <br>
                    I be looking for a face I know? Or a pair of eyes<br>
                    I had once loved?</p>
                <p>

                    I look in the mirror and I look for myself, but<br>
                    I see a masked figure staring at me. Tell me what colour my eyes are <br>
                    I have not seen them in a year. <br>
                    I have forgotten what it is to see myself in a mirror <br>
                    I only see the dead masked figure. </p>
                <p>

                    I spat blood the other day, into the empty alley in my room <br>
                    I still see the stains on my walls, nice little memos of ‘you’re going to die’, but <br>
                    I died the day I called a sunny day ‘happiness’. </p>
                <p>

                    I stare at the masked figure. Call me by my name, help me trick myself <br>
                    I am still the person I used to be. <br>
                    I stare at the masked figure again, Tell me <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What colour are my eyes?<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do your eyes look like mine?<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do your hands fit mine?<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do I see you and remember a dead part of me?<br> </span>
