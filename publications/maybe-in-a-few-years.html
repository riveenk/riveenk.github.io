            <br>
            <p>Maybe in a few years<br>
            I will see you holding a child<br>
            or twins, I'll be an uncle<br>
            holding those balls of sunshine</p>

            <p>Maybe in a few years<br>
            I will see you teary eyed<br>
            Next to me, as she walks down<br>
            the aisle for you</p>

            <p>Maybe in a few years<br>
            I will hear my phone ring and<br>
            I will see all of your faces<br>
            again, and we will laugh like before</p>

            <p>Maybe in a few years<br>
            I will be telling people about you<br>
            Our late night calls, our<br>
            fights and jokes</p>

            <p>But until those maybe years<br>
            happen, I will be on call with you<br>
            Laughing till I can't breathe<br>
            Hours after sun has set</p>

            <p>But until those maybe years<br>
            happen, I will take screenshots of<br>
            us, and make plans that may<br>
            happen, and end every call with love</p>
