            <p>In the loving cradle of relative safety <br>
                I tell the children of a tale down south. <br>
                They paint the skies with yellow sparks <br>
                And cheer all night with smoke around.</p>
                
                <p>They have no children, no sick, no elderly— <br>
                They're only others, the cost of this art. <br>
                When they are gone, we’ll build a new home <br>
                And kick some dirt over the criminal's bones.</p>
                
                <p>“Why?” they question, “why the yellow sparks? <br>
                We have no sparks, and we love them too.” <br>
                You are children. You are loved. <br>
                They are targets that must be crushed.</p>
                
                <p>Yet they pester, with minds corrupt— <br>
                “They are human too,” they say. <br>
                “They would love to play with us <br>
                And paint our skies with yellow sparks.”</p>
                
                <p>They know not of the others’ horror, <br>
                They speak in tongues foreign to us. <br>
                This home is ours, and they, a tenant; <br>
                The rent is due—and the price is death.</p>
