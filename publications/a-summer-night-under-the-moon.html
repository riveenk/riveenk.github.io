            <h4 class="body-subheader" >Sheet 8</h4>
            <p>The moon is out and in its distant glow<br>
            We reach out and find comfort and warmth<br>
            Me beside you, you beside me<br>
            We stare, hopeless, into the sky</p>

            <p>Lunar beauty often traps the mind<br>
            Lures it away from the vast void of the sky<br>
            The human mind, quite helpless, falls<br>
            Victim to the mirage, divinely bright</p>

            <p>In this tiny world, under the endless sky<br>
            Who are we to claim what's low and what's high<br>
            The moon from the earthly lands, seems as fire<br>
            Is to water, to the earth from selenian lands

            <p>Free from the pretence of beauty of luna<br>
            I keep staring into the darker night<br>
            Stars unknown and lands undiscovered<br>
            Wink in mockery of our feeble minds</p>

            <p>What is love, in this grand scheme, what is life?<br>
            For all our tears and blood flow for a speck of dust<br>
            A fraction of a second in the scale of God<br>
            Is it to love and feel what is given<br>
            Or is it to venture out and find answers to questions unasked?</p>

            <p>But, In this summer night with you beside me<br>
            Nothing makes sense<br>
            The moon that haunted romances of centuries<br>
            comes second to your beauty<br>
            And the universe that God willed to be endless<br>
            comes second to the love I have for you<br>
            So yes, the night's beautiful<br>
            But oh darling, how insignificant are we<br>
            In this baffling art of god, unfathomable?</p>
