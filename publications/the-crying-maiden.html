                <p class="indent">He was a man of many tastes and of a complex mind. His mind was just as
                    orderly-chaotic as his office.
                    Professor Senavitharana invited Aimee and Timora into his office. Earlier in the evening, the
                    Professor
                    had
                    mentioned a new rare painting the department had acquired. It was one by an artist unheard of
                    before,
                    only
                    introduced as Delacroix in his single work. The painting itself was not of particular interest. It
                    featured
                    a crying maiden as she held the still body of her lover.</p>
                <p class="dialogue">Professor,” Aimee raised her hand.</p>
                <p class="dialogue">You don’t have to do that here, Aimee. How can I help?”</p>
                <p class="dialogue">Sorry, Professor. I was wondering why the painting is in your office.”</p>
                <p class="dialogue">Ah, that is because this painting was gifted to me by its previous owner. I decided
                    to have a closer
                    look
                    at it before actually giving it to the department.”</p>
                <p class="dialogue">But why give it away?” Timora asked.</p>
                <p class="dialogue">What use would I have for this painting except to study it?” Prof. Senavitharana
                    said.</p>
                <p>He proceeded on to share the tale of the painting. The painting was signed for the 23rd of November,
                    1348;
                    however, even a student could realise that some parts of it were much more recent. Especially of the
                    still
                    man, which even Prof. Senavitharana could swear could be as recent as a month old. The running men
                    in
                    the
                    background appeared to be from different time periods, with different amounts of discolouration on
                    each.
                </p>
                <p class="dialogue">“Its previous owner, who wishes to remain anonymous, has shared a dark tale
                    associated with this
                    painting.
                    They claim it to have taken away their husband and even pointed at a relatively new figure in the
                    background. They only asked me to not let any men near the painting after sunset.”</p>
                <p class="dialogue">“But Professor, do you not believe in that? for you to be near the painting?” Aimee
                    asked, worried.</p>
                <p class="dialogue">Our benefactor never had a husband, Aimee. And I’ve worked with many other ‘cursed'
                    paintings, but you
                    can
                    see that I’m still alive and whole.”</p>
                <p class="dialogue">It’s not like the woman will grab –” A panicked scream interrupted Timora.</p>
                <p class="dialogue">The eyes, the eyes!” Aimee screamed, grabbing onto Timora, “The eyes moved!”</p>
                <p>Visibly concerned, Prof. Senavitharana turned to see that the Maiden's eyes had indeed raised. To his
                    much
                    discomfort, the eyes seemed to be looking directly at Prof. Senavitharana.</p>
                <p class="dialogue">Yeah, no,” Prof. Senavitharana said, “we’re leaving now. I’m sure the eyes were on
                    the man too.”</p>
                <p>Though once sceptical, even Timora struggled with her steps as she grabbed Aimee’s hand and ran out
                    of
                    the
                    office. Prof. Senavitharana followed them and shut the door behind them. As he was stumbling with
                    the
                    key to
                    lock the door, they could hear faint footsteps, almost as if they were wet, and a haunting laughter
                    riddled
                    with archaic French. Then, the footsteps stopped, and the door was finally locked.</p>
                <p>Suddenly, Prof. Senavitharana was aware of something looking at him. He looks around and sees nothing
                    except
                    his students, but then he notices something unusual. He blinks, and he is alone; there’s a faint
                    shadow
                    at
                    the end of a corridor.</p>
                <p>He blinks again, and he is back with the students.
                    He blinks again, and the shadow has a faint glint to it.
                    He blinks again, and he is back with the students.
                    He blinks again, and he can see a heavier glimpse of the Maiden, now much closer.
                    He sees the Maiden in her familiar dress—blood-stained and crumpled—but her tears are no longer
                    tears
                    but
                    deep-red streaks of blood; her crying face now hosts a smile too wide, and her eyes have no irises;
                    in
                    her
                    walk, an unnatural grace.
                    He blinked again, but he was still there.
                    He blinked, and he blinked, and he blinked, and he blinked, but to no avail.</p>
                <p class="dialogue">Why are you so eager to leave, Professor?” the Maiden spoke in an unnerving lilt.
                </p>
                <p class="dialogue">The professor said nothing in reply. Actually, he could not reply; his mind spoke
                    back and screamed, but
                    nothing materialised in the world. He was screaming in fear, but his only evidence was his eyes.</p>
                <p class="dialogue">I have waited for you, Nalaka,” she says. “I have waited for you for a while now.”
                </p>
                <p>Her hands were reaching for him. He tried to run, to fight back, but he could not even move. He was a
                    mannequin, and now he only belonged to the Maiden.</p>
                <p class="dialogue">You remind me of my lover,” the Maiden said, “you might even look just like him.”
                </p>
                <p class="dialogue">Your lover died, Prof. Senavitharana thinks. He died some seven hundred years ago.
                </p>
                <p class="dialogue">Now, darling, that’s not very nice of you, is it?” she asks, almost as if she heard
                    his thoughts.</p>
                <p>She holds him, and her hands melt into wet paint that stains and then begins to cover Prof.
                    Senavitharana.
                    The paint is cold, unnatural, and viscous. It feels like it weighs him down, but also like he is
                    melting
                    into it. The Maiden’s smile is still too wide, her eyes still bloody, and her easy stance was still
                    unnerving. The paint had now covered up to the Professor’s neck, and it was still inching up, hungry
                    for
                    him. The Maiden slowly leans in towards Prof. Senavitharana’s ear.</p>
                <p class="dialogue">Now we can be together forever,” she whispered. Her face melts into the Professor’s
                    as his eyes remain
                    the
                    last to be swallowed, struck with only fear and a silent acceptance of defeat.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
                <p>No one knows of a Prof. Senavitharana anymore.
                    No one ever did. He never existed.
                    Prof. Suriarachchi has always existed in place of Prof. Senavitharana.
                    The painting still exists and is inside Prof. Suriarachchi’s office.
                    Aimee and Timora will remember a ghost of Prof. Senavitharana; they will fear the painting and beg
                    everyone
                    to get rid of it.
                    They will soon forget it, too; everyone forgets their nightmares one day.
                    But the painting will come to life every night.
                    The Maiden is happy but still hungry, and she will raise her eyes to look at you and smile.</p>
