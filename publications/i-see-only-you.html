                <p>
                    Your eyes, those beautiful blue eyes,<br>
                    ever so vivid, even as the red lies<br>
                    over your soaked dress, painting you<br>
                    into the mess my mind outgrew.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my mirror I see naught of myself<br>
                    but the man who killed you: myself.<br>
                    I wish I were gone, you put in my place,<br>
                    but sin infects me with thoughts of disgrace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No price is ever too great for you, I cry<br>
                    as lifeless bodies on my table lie.<br>
                    Skin tone, just like yours.<br>
                    A round nose, just like yours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If God exists, he'd watch me in pride<br>
                    as I carve from myself my own bride.<br>
                    Stitched together, mine for what's yours,<br>
                    or to mimic what the truth lures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My mismatched skin now glows in your tones.<br>
                    A hint of you covers every inch of my bones.<br>
                    Your arms so soft, so lovely, so slender,<br>
                    a perfect model to carve my flesh tender.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my mirror an image grows that yearns<br>
                    to be you. An act of desperation that learns<br>
                    from each corpse, each incision made—<br>
                    lips, ears, and a head with a French braid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My eyes are now two shades away from yours.<br>
                    Every curve of my body was sketched from yours.<br>
                    The stitches sting; each prick has a hint of blue.<br>
                    I hope I'm hurting more than I hurt you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Relics of bone and rotting decay in your<br>
                    worship. The proof of my love lies on the floor<br>
                    for you to see. I hope you see what I've done for you<br>
                    for when I look in the mirror, I see only you.
