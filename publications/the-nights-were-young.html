            <p class="pretext">Aragalaya ("Struggle") was one of the most
pivotal events I have ever witnessed and taken
part in. It was an experience of both pride and
fear alike. Ousting a family of war criminals
and thieves, along with the toxic political
world they built, cost more than just sweat
and tears. Walking among brave protesters,
trembling as buses burned nearby, I too lived
through this period of change. Sri Lanka has
always been my home at heart, and I am
proud that I have fought for it. I'm glad I can
share a part of our story through this poem.</p>

            <p>
                Spring-touched breeze and a soothing sun—<br>
                the days were bright, but the nights were young.<br>
                Candles lit, their sins were sung.<br>
                The Asian Spring has just begun.</p><p>
                The wind will sing in freedom's voice<br>
                as we march in peaceful stride.<br>
                But alas! Our hearts have sighed,<br>
                for the wretched ones neglect our choice</p><p>
                sitting on their thrones of bones—yours and mine,<br>
                in their palaces—bound together in tears and blood,<br>
                lying drunk and dancing, as our sorrows flood,<br>
                in joyous tones, the damned lot, in old exotic wine.</p><p>
                Spineless fools sold their souls for a measly price<br>
                and forgot who fights for them. They think the foes<br>
                hold banners in hand, and concern in heart, but the world knows<br>
                the red scarfs have bargained the fools' pride for a pint and rice.</p><p>
                Blood was spilled, ours and theirs, both undeserved.<br>
                Frightened eyes watched khaki figures fight<br>
                their own kin, as the burning buses leaked cruel light.<br>
                Then night fell, hearts burning, yet too many unnerved.</p><p>
                We stand together as children of one<br>
                and watch the wretched Mynah fly.<br>
                Dance, my friends, better days draw nigh.<br>
                Under the soothing sun, rebirth has begun.
